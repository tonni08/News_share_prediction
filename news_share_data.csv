The move could mark one of the biggest challenges to YouTube's audience dominance and create serious competition in the online video world.

As of September 2013, more than 17% of all Internet traffic was going to YouTube. The only site to have more traffic than that was another streaming video behemoth -- Netflix. With so many Internet users looking for video content, and with so many video creators left unhappy due to changing content ID rules and low monetization rates, it only makes sense that competitors should start to rise.

Citing ""sources aware of Google's plans,"" Engadget said(Opens in a new window) Google is currently testing the new app, which will be pushed to Android users as a separate update, and won't be part of the forthcoming Android 4.4.3 update.

The new portrait mode will allow users to shoot photos with a shallower depth of field, enabling the subject to appear in focus, while the background is blurred; this is similar to features built into the new HTC One.

Engadget reported that the update will include improvements to the way images are framed within the camera.

We're told that Google has finally fixed issues with the default camera's photo framing, allowing users to snap images with a new 100 percent no-crop viewfinder. That means you'll see exactly what your Android device will capture before you hit the shutter button, with no unwanted objects creeping in at the edges.

The update will also reportedly add improvements to the camera's existing panorama and Portrait Sphere modes, which will enhance image resolution. Third-party developers will also have the opportunity to develop filters that can be used within the camera.

The Cupertino, Calif., company plans to begin production on new screens in May, Reuters reported(Opens in a new window), citing supply-chain sources.

[seealso slug=""this-apple-iphone-air-concept-looks-like-the-real-thing""]

Apple will reportedly begin producing the 4.7-inch screen next month, while work on the 5.5-inch screen could be delayed. Production of the screens is linked to a fall release date for the next version of Apple's flagship smartphone, sources claimed.

Sharp, LG Display and Japan Display are on the list of manufacturers who could be making the screens, sources said.

An increase in size from current the 4-inch screen on the iPhone 5S would likely quiet some of the concerns from iPhone fans and analysts alike that Apple has been missing out on consumers interested in more screen real estate.

The production delay for the 5.5-inch screen is reportedly due to complications related to problems with in-cell production technology, which may result in a shift to film-sensor technology rather than in-cell technology for the larger screen.

Of course, planning an elaborate prank on your friends and family in real life takes a lot of time and energy. Who wants to spend countless hours on a one-time event when you could just be an Internet troll? It's economical!

[seealso slug=easy-pranks/]

But the flood of fake sonograms and bogus engagements on April 1 will only cause a never-ending chain reaction of eye-rolling from your Facebook friends. Half the fun in pranking is getting people to believe you, and these jokes have completely lost their spark.

Do everyone's News Feed a favor and step up your pranking game.",4/1/2014 0:00,0.508511,26,8,0,4.713427,7,Tech,3030.861,4622.544,3761.262,3700,0.484539,0.13452,0.0501,0.026052,0.4,-0.15,2000
7014271,Why Tech Takes April Fools' Day So Seriously,"Tech journalists hate April Fools' Day. Not because we don't like a good joke -- heck, who doesn't? -- but because we're basically recycling PR stunts on behalf of the companies we cover.

Just keeping track of Google on April 1 is a full-time occupation. By my count, the company had 14 pranks this year. (Does that mean there will be 15 next year?) But Google's hardly alone. Microsoft, Twitter, LinkedIn, Nokia, Samsung, Kickstarter, Roku and Tumblr, just to name a few, have tried their hands at goofs this April Fools'.

For Google, the tomfoolery dates back to 2000, when it introduced MentalPlex, a feature that let you summon a search by staring at a GIF. The company also introduced goofy error messages (sample: ""Error 006: Query is unclear. Try again after removing hat, glasses and shoes."")

Such lightheartedness has worked in Google's favor. Whenever the company makes a questionable call on privacy or security or tries to herd consumers to Google Plus, the effect is mitigated by the company's benign, playful brand image. It's like trying to hate a stuffed animal.

Other techies have taken note. There's probably no more divisive company than Microsoft, but the company craftily engages in self-parody, which disarms the haters. This year's prank(Opens in a new window), which involves the return of the much-hated Clippy, will create more goodwill than a $2 million TV ad buy.

So, while there is likely some playful spirit at work, launching an April Fool's Day prank is also very good PR.

However, not everyone is anxious to don the fool's cap. Notable tech holdouts include IBM and Apple, two members of the old guard (in IBM's case really old guard) for whom an April Fools' prank would seem incongruous and weird. Even though Apple was founded on April 1, the company has been reluctant to celebrate the day.

That's not to say that Apple lacks a sense of humor. The company's ""Get a Mac"" ads(Opens in a new window) were certainly funny at times, but the humor always came at the expense of the stuffed-shirt PC guy (John Hodgman). As a brand, Apple seems allergic to self-parody. The company's humor instead stems from superiority. Now that Apple is the biggest tech brand in the world, though, that kind of humor seems mean-spirited. So Apple is a bit of a stick in the mud. A stick in the mud that makes terrific products.

Comparatively, Google's humor is based in absurdity. The jokes are almost always a comment on the company's penchant for experimentation outpacing the experiments' utility. For instance, Gmail Shelfies let you use a self-portrait as your Gmail background, a great innovation that no one is asking for. Note, however, that even in the seeming self-parody, there's some implicit puffery going on, too. The message: We're so geeky and brilliant that we sometimes forget how this stuff applies to real life.

At the moment, fans are eating it up. In the long run, the joke may be on Google, though, says Gene Grabowski, a senior strategist at PR firm Levick(Opens in a new window).

""April Fools' jokes belong inside the company,"" he says. ""Putting them out there publicly where they're possibly misperceived is inappropriate.""

Grabowski predicts that as Google becomes more of an elder statesman, it will have to put away the floppy shoes forever.

""As these companies and this industry matures you're going to see fewer and fewer of these jokes,"" he says. ""You don't see Procter & Gamble making these kind of jokes.""

Hayes Roth, CMO of Landor Associates(Opens in a new window), though, says tech brands like Google are smart to latch on to April Fools'.

""We often talk about how brands need to have a human face,"" he says. ""For a tech brand, that can sometimes be difficult.""

Content-wise, Gmail users aren't interested(Opens in a new window) in emails sent by email domains pertaining to medical, dental, health care and government topics. However, they appear to be very interested in domains relating to mobile, software and web apps.

7014086,8 Simple Tips to Maximize Career Fulfillment,"Finding a career that youâ€™re passionate about isn't always a picnic. A 2013 Gallup poll (Opens in a new window) suggests that 70% of workers either dislike their jobs or are completely disengaged with what they do.

As managing director of Heard City(Opens in a new window), a growing company in New York, Iâ€™m constantly meeting with people young and old who are struggling with the daily frustration and boredom of their current workplaces. Figuring out what you truly want to do with your life is a challenge for many people; below are eight tips to help you find a fulfilling career path.

1. Write down who you are

What do you like to do after work hours or on the weekends? Write down all of your personality traits or interests -- you might surprise yourself with what you find. Whether itâ€™s a baby step or a huge leap, every day you should challenge yourself to embark on something that plays to your passions; you never know when you might stumble upon a career path (or a side project that ultimately turns into a full-time gig) that aligns with them.

Remember the old saying, ""Dress for the job you want, not the job you have?"" The same rings true for how you conduct yourself every day: You need to embody the person that you want to be in order to become her.

2. Say goodbye to your comfort zone

After a certain amount of time in a specific city, industry or job title, it can be easy to start feeling ""stuck."" Let go of behaviors that keep you feeling this way and try new things, no matter how different (or intimidating) they might be. Take a risk: Try a class, go to a networking happy hour or attend a conference or event. You might learn something new about yourself, professionally or personally.

3. Be extremely selective with your time

Donâ€™t overbook -- you can't be everywhere 24/7. Time is precious, so try to be as selective as possible with the activities that you choose to pursue, and make sure they're really worth the investment. On a related note, don't underestimate the importance of down time or ""me"" time. Allotting time in your schedule for self-reflection is healthy.

4. Use networking and social media to your advantage

Actively pursue and study the industry in which you want to be involved (even if it's not the one you're currently working within). Hiring managers are more likely to open and review a resume that is passed along by a client, friend or peer, so take a look at your network and determine which connections could potentially lead to a job, and don't be afraid to take a risk and reach out.

On social media, be sure to connect with brands, companies and professionals on LinkedIn that you admire or that interest you. Follow people or industry influencers on Twitter and Instagram that inspire you both professionally and personally. These relationships donâ€™t happen overnight; they require time, effort and care, but they will be worth it in the end.

5. Find a mentor who will vouch for you

Here's a crucial one: Find a mentor in the industry you want to work. While you have to be your biggest advocate, it doesnâ€™t hurt to have someone else be your cheerleader as well. Meet with your mentor on a regular basis -- ask them questions and advice and use the information you glean to your advantage.

6. Donâ€™t be afraid to say 'no' (or to hear it)

As humans, we are scared of failure; itâ€™s one of our biggest downfalls. You aren't always going to win at everything, and sometimes you are going to have to make calls that you are afraid to make. This means that you will hear 'no' sometimes, but donâ€™t let that little word discourage you; let it motivate you and drive you forward.

7. Youâ€™re valuable, so invest in yourself

Whether that means going back to school at age 40 or deciding that your current job isnâ€™t inspiring you anymore and changing careers completely, you need to invest in yourself. You are never too old or too young to learn, so take some time for yourself and create opportunities on your own.

8. Become a 'gardener'

At the end of the day, you need to take a step back and figure out what you find the most fulfilling and what mark you ultimately want to leave. You must navigate all of your various interests and pick one (or two) that you want to grow -- think about that interest as a plant. Take care of and nurture it. You don't have to walk away from other things; just focus more on what you love the most and bring that passion to fruition.

When it comes down to it, most people arenâ€™t truly ""lost"" -- they often just need to apply direction and focus.

6234475,Everyone Loves the Cloud Price Wars -- For Now,"For consumers, the recent price war over storage has been a pleasant surprise. For Internet companies, though, it's been a cause for an extended wave of high fives.

â€œOne of my CEOs declared to me the other day that last week's activity in the cloud may have been one of the most important weeks in technology history, but we won't realize it for many years to come,â€ wrote Jeff Bussgang, a general partner at venture capital firm Flybridge Capital.

[seealso slug=http://mashable.com/2013/08/26/what-is-the-cloud/]

Why? Specialization is a powerful economic force. It fueled the Industrial Revolution, and it has quietly transformed the digital world.

Humans once did all their farming and building themselves, much like startups used to build out their own infrastructure. This was a necessary but not particularly efficient system.

As farmers and blacksmiths emerged to generate more labor through specialization, so have specialized cloud computing and services become the backbone that fuels startups and Fortune 500 companies alike. Netflixâ€™s interface operates on Amazon Web Services (AWS) and has no plans of leaving, a spokesperson said.

Which is why last week's announcements of price cuts to the cloud services of Google and Amazon -- two of the most widely used cloud services -- resonated across the Internet.

The price is right

Picturelife, a startup that organizes usersâ€™ picture and videos, relies on Amazon cloud services, and its bills started piling up. When Google dropped its prices, the company began to consider a switch.

â€œWe doubled the size of our photo archive and therefore our database as well. Then we started to see that this can be really expensive,â€ said Nate Westheimer, cofounder and CEO of Picturelife(Opens in a new window). â€œWe knew it would be, and we started to reassess some of our architectural decisions and look for ways to cut costs.â€

The next day, Amazon dropped its prices, too. Picturelife stayed with Amazon, which Westheimer said played a critical role in the company from the start. Westheimer said he doesn't believe he could have created a company if cloud services like Amazon's didn't exist.

Amazon is best known as an e-commerce giant that also dabbles in media. Among web businesses it serves a very different role. Amazon Web Services is the industrial farmer of the Internet, a cloud-based service that takes care of the arduous -- but necessary -- tasks that once cost startups large chunks of their capital.

Demand for this type of service has produced a market with no shortage of options. Google and Microsoft offer similar services, while Dropbox and Box lead a raft of smaller companies.

Prices for consumers are low, with most services offering a certain amount of free storage to individuals users. While still cheaper than building its own infrastructure, cloud services do get expensive. In a blog post, Westheimer pointed to Everpix(Opens in a new window), another photo storage startup that eventually ran up a bill with Amazon that it couldn't pay, forcing the company to close its doors.

Stronger, better, faster, cheaper

Two important factors precipitated the price cut: growing competition between established players and plenty of new entrants into the market, along with improvements in technology that lowered the operating cost for service providers.

â€œWe knew [the price cut] was coming. They're very large companies that have continued to innovate over time and that's what makes them so successful,â€ said Mitch Wainer, cofounder and chief marketing officer of cloud services startup DigitalOcean. â€œThe prices were a little too high. Knowing the business side of infrastructure, I know what their margins were in ballpark range, and they had plenty of room to cut back. They knew they could cut back and still be profitable.â€

DigitialOcean(Opens in a new window) is one of a variety of cloud startups seeking its niche. The company targets developers that want complex features in a simplified interface. Other companies, like StackDriver(Opens in a new window), sprung up around the space to help monitor cloud services.

Falling prices are great for consumers and companies, but savings can be fleeting. Growing companies can rapidly increase reliance on services, leaving them victims of their own success.

Yuri Sagalov, cofounder and CEO of personal cloud startup AeroFS, said mounting data needs will offset falling costs.

â€œI think that the price of storage is continually going down, but at the same time the amount of data we're creating is exploding,â€ said Sagalov, who is also a part-time partner at Y Combinator. â€œTen years ago there were so few companies that had petabyte storage arrays.â€

You get what you pay for

Falling prices call into question whether the quality of the services will remain at the same level. A Christmas Eve problem with AWS caused an outage of Netflix and other customers. While startups may be without other options for services, larger companies that are built on a single service rely heavily on the cloud provider.

""I can only assume both AWS and Google are going to offset the price drop by further over-subscription of their services to maintain margins,â€ said Lance Crosby, CEO of SoftLayer, IBMâ€™s cloud infrastructure service in an email. â€œThe financial benefit will be erased by the performance degradation leaving the customer at status quo.â€

For now, Internet companies will enjoy a little more cash in their pockets. But if cloud prices continue to drop, the market could risk underpricing itself and minimizing necessary competition.

Box, which now trades publicly, operates at a loss having generated $124.2 million in revenue in its last fiscal year resulting in a loss of $168.8 million. The company has said it does not expect to be profitable(Opens in a new window) in the near term as it continues to invest in the fast-growing, competitive market.

Raghu Kulkarni, founder and CEO of iDrive(Opens in a new window), among the oldest cloud storages companies around, said price drops are a good thing, but they can turn ugly if companies focus only on taking market share.

â€œOverall it's a helpful thing. From a consumer perspective, it's a great thing,â€ he said. â€œWhat one needs to be careful is about the extent of these drops. If someone is doing this just for the sake of gaining market share at a loss with an eye on the future, I think that's a dangerous game to play.â€",4/1/2014 0:00,0.610619,2,1,1,4.460526,5,Business,1203.476,3581.094,2476.525,0,0.449306,0.087153,0.026316,0.013158,0,0,733

Further blurring the lines between TVs and mobile devices, Comedy Central launched an all-new app Tuesday that will offer a generous helping of its flagship content for free -- and weâ€™re talking full episodes here, not just clips or extras -- on smartphones and tablets.

[seealso slug=""ipad-apps-free""]

Existing separate apps for The Daily Show With Jon Stewart and The Colbert Report, which mostly offered snippets and second-screen goodies, have been scuttled effective immediately. And for good reason: The network's entire late-night lineup, which includes Chris Hardwickâ€™s @midnight, will be offered on the app for next-day viewing, as will the most recent season of South Park.

""This is TV moving to the tablet, not the website. The idea is bigger than the app -- this is the network,"" Steve Grimes, SVP of multi-platform programming and strategy, told Mashable during a demo before its rollout.

Though much of its front-facing content is free, pay-TV subscribers can log in to get the full range of Comedy Centralâ€™s on-air programming, plus a few bonuses â€“ most notably the entire season of Chapelleâ€™s Show.

The content is ad-supported, with AXE Peace and Corona Extra signed up as initial sponsors, though youâ€™ll appreciate that your show stars playing immediately -- thereâ€™s no preroll, and sponsor ads go where the commercials otherwise would. Much of Comedy Central's content will still be available on other platforms, such as Hulu and Amazon.

The app itself is elegant, minimalist and easy to navigate (see screenshot above). Though there are share buttons and a few second-screen features, itâ€™s sharply focused on delivering full episodes to you mobile device, with intuitive customized settings to ensure your favorites are front-and-center. Still, extra goodies like original shorts and standup clips are easy to find.

All app users will be able to preview two yet-to-premiere new series, the animated Trip Tank and Comedy Underground with Dave Attell, an uncensored stand-up series.

""It's one thing to dub exciting motor noises over a mundane-sounding car, but to plop engine sounds on a car that most folks realize is nearly silent? That just seems . . . bizarre,"" he wrote.

CBS told the Associated Press that the sounds had been removed to the online version. However this promo version still retained some of the engine noises as of early Tuesday afternoon.

7029879,The Future of Email: The Internet's Least Exciting Application,"Email is not sexy. That is to say, the design and functionality of electronic mail, since its inception, have remained fundamentally consistent and relatively unexciting-- we type out messages, send them to our contacts and wait for a reply.

In 10 years, that foundation will still exist, but we'll likely have a lot more options.

SEE ALSO: 10 Chain Emails That Haunted Your Youth

According to experts, such as Yesware(Opens in a new window) founder Matthew Bellows, the time for email to expand and innovate is now.

""There was an idea that email was dead a few years ago,"" Bellows tells Mashable. ""That's just not true, obviously.""

Though competing messaging platforms and other options have come and gone, email has remained perhaps the primary use of the Internet since it began. When Gmail entered the mix 10 years ago, the seeds of evolution were planted. Now, email seems due for another great change.

We reached out to developers and designers like Bellows to see what those changes will look like, and how they'll affect the way we send and receive email.

1. The dawn of third-party applications

Currently, most major email providers do not expressly support third-party applications. This makes it challenging for other companies, beyond the provider, to increase the usefulness of email as a whole for users with niche needs. For Bellows and the team at Yesware, whose tool is built on top of preexisting email providers to allow users simpler solutions to common business problems, this fact makes it difficult to grow.

""We're kind of hacked in right now,"" Bellows says. ""Every time Gmail changes, we have to change.""

According to Bellows, email providers would be wise to encourage more and easier third-party programming. He believes that when Facebook launched its ""Facebook Platform"" for third-party development in 2007, the value of its service exploded. Users could go to Facebook for niche interests such as gaming, and all Facebook had to do was open the door. Users stayed on Facebook longer, third-party developers had an easier time reaching customers and your over-sharing aunt was able to play Farmville to her heart's content.

The Email Game - Conquer your Email(Opens in a new window) from Baydin Inc.(Opens in a new window) on Vimeo(Opens in a new window).

In 10 years, Bellows sees third-party development exploding on email services like Gmail.

""I don't think [Gmail is] against it, I think it's a matter of priority for them,"" says Bellows. ""I think it says something that in the meantime, they haven't shut us down.""

Gmail Product Manager Alex Gawley doesn't disagree with Bellows prediction, but sees third-party development happening in different ways.

""It's less about third-party devs building on top of Gmail than building within the emails that they send,"" Gawley tells Mashable. To him, the future will be about senders putting richer information within emails -- package tracking data, surveys, etc. -- rather than building apps to improve the service itself.

2. Smarter input, history and management

""What's going to be constant is this: We will be sending each other electronic messages and we will have way too many of them,"" Bellows says.

According to him, the usefulness of speech recognition tools such as the iPhone's Siri have yet to be fully developed. In the future, he believes more of us will send emails through voice input programs rather than keyboards. Pointing to Google Glass as an example, Bellows sees email adjusting and adapting to innovative new tech in ways that, for now, remain largely speculative.

Augmented intelligence, Bellows says, will help us figure out what to say, along with whom to say it to. And our conversation histories will more adequately inform us about whom we speak to and and how we know them. All of this, it seems, will help to increase the productivity of the ever-increasing pool of digital workers.

3. Personalized design

Kevin Fox, former user experience design lead at Google and the original creator of the Gmail interface, sees the future of email design evolving on a similar path to that of the greater web.

""Email is so much the lowest common denominator in terms of design,"" Fox tells Mashable. ""Lots of communication that would've been done through email 10 years ago is now being done through chat, social networks and texting.""

More than ever, there is reason for email providers to start thinking seriously about design. To Fox, this means a greater focus on message building. Similar to Twitter bios or Facebook cover photos, Fox believes the emails you compose in the future will have more user personality included.

According to Fox, message composing could adapt a system somewhat similar to pre-built template documents, creating greater ease in messaging, depending on whom you're communicating with.

4. Large user growth through mobile

Approximately 6 billion people will be using email in 10 years, according to Bellows. As more of the world's population gets connected, the need for innovation and structural changes will only grow. Experts agree that most of those users will come from mobile.

""Mobile usage is growing very fast -- that's why we've invested so heavily in it,"" Gawley says. ""That's certainly where we see a lot of growth.""

According to Fox, the increase in mobile use will likely lead to more ways users can send emails. ""Email on mobile devices is more of a reading tool,"" he says. ""You'll compose a message if you have to, but it'll be shorter and there'll be mistakes.""

Fox believes more and more emails will be created in ways other than through simply opening a compose window typing up a message.

While the future of email is largely hypothetical at this point in time, it seems clear that it will finally get a bit more exciting.

6643246,Game Developers Ditch YouTube Reality Show After Uncomfortable First Day of Filming,"Bring in well-established indie game developers. Add a lot of cameras and premise for a YouTube reality show. Then throw in serious product placement from Mountain Dew and stir up accusations of producers manipulating cast members to get reactions.

If all accounts are accurate, this is how potential reality show GAME_JAM ended production after only one day, as the 11 indie developers asked to participate left the set in anger. The show was a production of Maker Studios' subchannel Polaris, which focuses on games and gaming culture.

According to Jared Rosen, a journalist who does contract work for Polaris and writes about independent games, the reality show was originally pitched as something representing the spirit of the indie games community, but became ""misguided"" as more people and money got involved. Rosen was on the set and wrote about the whole experience on Indie Statik(Opens in a new window).

The idea was to ""document the ups and downs of actually developing a game â€“ hopefully sharing that experience with a viewership likely ranging into the hundreds of thousands, possibly millions,"" Rosen wrote -- at least that's what drew the 11 developers to travel to Los Angeles for the shoot.

""More importantly, it would be an opportunity for the group to share the closely-knit spirit of togetherness unique to indie development, presented through the lens of popular YouTube personalities with massive, mostly younger built-in viewerships,"" he continued. ""A slam dunk, you might say, created in earnest to shine a kind of light into the often misrepresented world of creating ... or, at least, thatâ€™s what everyone thought.""

Rosen's account coincides with blog posts written by three participants: Robin Arnott(Opens in a new window), Adriel Wallick(Opens in a new window) and Zoe Quinn(Opens in a new window), who characterize the experience coming to a head after the teams were on camera with producer Matti Leshem. Rosen said Lesham seemed to work for Pepsi/Mountain Dew, and ""barr[ed] any drink that wasnâ€™t water or Dew from being consumed while the cameras were rolling.""

Lesham was then reported as questioning the teams as to whether having female members gave them an advantage or disadvantage. Wallick writes he said ""Do you think youâ€™re at an advantage because you have a pretty girl on your team?"" to her teammates, which she said eventually got her ""with an embarrassed and flushed red face launch into a statement about how his question is indicative of everything that is wrong in our industry in terms of sexism.""

That line of questioning was followed with, according to Wallick, ""Do you think the teams with women on them are at a disadvantage?""

Rosen said this was the final straw for many of the developers, four of whom left the show outright. Afterwards, he said the team tried to work to reconcile, but couldn't reach an agreement.

There was uncomfortable begging. There were tears. A lot of heavy shit came out, and by the end of it all, Maker, Polaris and the dev teams had said their peace [sic] and resolved to move forward â€¦ later.

7013433,5 Reasons You Should Care About the GM Recall,"Congress on Tuesday will grill(Opens in a new window) General Motorsâ€™ new CEO Mary Barra about a defective ignition switch in the company's cars that's responsible for more than a dozen deaths over the past decade. GM has so far recalled 2.6 million cars as a result of the defect.

While much of Tuesday's hearing will focus on problems of the past, it has the potential to change GM's future. Here are five reasons why you should care.

1. It could have been you -- in your first car.

At least 13 people have died in GM vehicles that have been linked to the defect, and some say that number could reach 25 -- or more. The majority of the victims killed in the crashes were young, and many of them were women, all of whom were driving small, entry-level cars like the Chevrolet Cobalt and the Saturn Ion. For some of them, these were their first cars.

The defect is a result of a faulty ignition switch that causes cars to suddenly switch off. This then stiffens the brakes, causes a loss of power steering and disables the air bags -- a cruel chain of events that may have sent inexperienced drivers careening off the road and to their deaths.

""With an entry-level car where you have a newly licensed driver, the freak-out will win the day,"" Robert Hilliard, a Texas personal injury lawyer with lawsuits against GM, told the Associated Press(Opens in a new window). ""All that those young drivers are going to do is respond to the panic.""

2. Both GM and federal regulators knew about the problem for years.

GM knew about the problem for years, and yet people continued to die, according to lawsuit depositions(Opens in a new window), federal attorneys(Opens in a new window) and a Congressional subcommittee's report(Opens in a new window).

""More than a decade ago, GM embarked on a small-car program,"" GM CEO Mary Barra will say at Tuesday's testimony, according to prepared remarks(Opens in a new window). ""Sitting here today, I cannot tell you why it took years for a safety defect to be announced in that program, but I can tell you that we will find out."" It took until February of this year for GM to issue the recall(Opens in a new window).

3. GM could have fixed the problem by spending a few more dollars.

GM could have replaced the defective part for only $2 to $5. â€œWe know that the difference between this switch and one that would have worked properly was life or death,â€ Senator Ed Markey said on Tuesday(Opens in a new window) outside the Capitol. â€œDo you know the other difference? Two dollars.â€

â€œCorporate executives made a decision that fighting the problem was cheaper and easier than fixing the problem,â€ added Laura Christian, a mother of one of the victims.

GM reportedly rejected a proposed fix for the problem in 2005 ""because it would have taken too long and cost too much,"" according(Opens in a new window) to The Wall Street Journal.

Ray DeGiorgio, chief switch engineer on the Cobalt, said in a sworn deposition that he couldn't explain why the original switch was changed and that he did not sign off on it. However, his story his contradicts a document that House investigators released. In that document, which has DeGiorgio's signature, he approved(Opens in a new window) the switch redesign.

4. A government agency failed to fix the problem, too.

Federal officials at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration decided not to open an inquiry into the defective ignition switches despite a number of reports between 2007 and 2010 that warned of accidents caused by the defect. The agency's own investigators warned of at least four fatal crashes and 29 complaints showing the problem of the disabled air bags, The New York Times reports, citing a memo(Opens in a new window) a House subcommittee released.

According to prepared testimony, NHTSA acting Administrator David Friedman will standby his agencyâ€™s handling of the complaints. â€œWe are not aware of any information to suggest that NHTSA failed to properly carry out its safety mission based on the data available to it and the process it followed,â€ he is expected to say.

5. This is a big test for the first female CEO of a major U.S. automaker.

GM CEO Mary Barra has been on the job for just three months -- and has spent the majority of the time apologizing for her predecessors failures in publicly identifying and fixing the problem.

""As soon as l learned about the problem, we acted without hesitation,"" she is expected to say on Tuesday, according to prepared remarks. ""We told the world we had a problem that needed to be fixed. We did so because whatever mistakes were made in the past, we will not shirk from our responsibilities now and in the future. Todayâ€™s GM will do the right thing.""

The tech giant spends an inordinate amount of time and resources every April 1 on pranking the Internet -- because, they own half of it -- so why not? This year's pranks include a new spin on the selfie, some Pokemon related challenges and emojis.

While we don't enjoy being fooled, we have to admit, Google, some of these wouldn't be so bad if they were real. Perhaps you put next year's pranking budget towards actually developing these?

1. The Gmail Shelfie

To celebrate Gmail's tenth birthday on April 1 (no, really, it's actually Gmail's anniversary), Google has announced a new custom theme for email accounts. And it's as Millennial as can be -- the ""shelfie.""

It stands for SHareable sELFIE and makes narcism just a touch more techy.

""Gmail Shelfie is built on the idea that you shouldnâ€™t be selfish with your selfie. With just a few clicks, your mom, your aunt, or that girl you have a crush on can set your Shelfie as their Gmail theme so they can enjoy checking, reading, and writing emails while seeing your friendly face in the background.""

7033844,How Google Fumbled Glass -- and How to Save It,"""Hey, is that Google Glass?""

The question came from a man on New York City's Fifth Avenue as I rushed to a meeting. He was correct. The blue apparatus on my face was indeed Google Glass, which I hadn't worn in public for a while. When I wore it for several periods during 2013, passers-by would typically wait a little longer before asking about it. They were usually excited.

[seealso slug=""google-glass-future""]

This was different. The man's tone was urgent, almost accusatory.

""Yes,"" I answered, not stopping -- mainly because I was late for my meeting, but also because something felt off about the exchange.

""Man, that's scary.""

Unsure of how to respond, I muttered a semi-sarcastic, ""Thanks.""

""It's not a compliment!"" he barked before turning and walking off the other way.

That was new. I'd been shot the occasional suspicious look while wearing Google Glass; never out-and-out hostility. As the drive-by heckling reverberated in my head, I couldn't help but think about the now-infamous Google Glass incident that had happened recently at a bar in San Francisco, where patrons, apparently irate at being potentially recorded (and then actually recorded), appear to have harassed and robbed a woman wearing Glass, with one of them snatching the device right off her face.

While the full picture of what happened during that particular episode remains in dispute (and the woman, Sarah Slocum, has hardly helped her case by trying to parlay her 15 minutes of fame into free trips from Google(Opens in a new window)), the incident became a watershed moment in the life of Google Glass. It was an indicator that public sentiment toward the device has taken a turn for the worse, perhaps irrevocably.

It didn't have to be this way. Sure, any connected device that puts a camera on a person's body automatically invites some kind of backlash. But Google, despite its good intentions, released Glass in a very unusual manner, and has stumbled along the way. You can trace back many of the image problems Glass is experiencing now to key decisions made earlier in the rollout.

So where did it all go wrong?

Cracked Glass

For evidence of the problem, you don't have to look farther than Google itself. Type the term ""Google Glass is"" in Google autocomplete to see what most people are searching for on the topic; it's not a pretty picture.

Credit: Google

If you peruse the comment threads(Opens in a new window) on anything written about the Slocum encounter, you'd think Glass was not just to blame for provoking the barfight, but also for San Francisco's gentrification issues, the eroding of privacy in general and, possibly, the coming war with the machines. At least one restaurant has banned Glass(Opens in a new window) because of the incident, and others were doing it already.

Slocum wasn't even officially a Glass Explorer at the time (although Google later extended an invitation), but the damage done is indisputable.

Even some of Glass's strongest advocates are souring on it. Robert Scoble, probably the earliest and most enthusiastic Glass Explorer, has been trashing the connected headset lately, first ripping apart the device itself(Opens in a new window) and later Google's entire strategy around it(Opens in a new window).

""All sorts of things are broken, like you can only put 10 contacts into [Glass] so using it as a phone accessory sucks,"" Scoble told Mashable, adding that Google's biggest mistake surrounding Glass has been in communication. ""[Privacy] has certainly hurt it in the press. I just don't have that many bad reactions in public. What is really wrong is it is so broken that it is hard to be positive about it with others.""

As an Explorer myself, I feel Scoble's pain even if I don't agree with all his criticisms (I like that Glass is designed explicitly to not keep you as connected as a smartphone). I also share Scoble's enthusiasm -- after using Glass for a while, I've seen the amazing potential of the technology. But watching incidents like Slocum's barfight take hold of the narrative has been a painful experience. With each complaint, it becomes harder not to admit there's something to what opponents are saying.

Google hasn't been sitting on its hands. The company published a pretty good guide to wearing Glass without being called a ""Glasshole,""(Opens in a new window) It continues the attempt to manage expectations, most recently by dispelling myths about Glass -- mainly the ones that creep people out, like exactly what that camera's doing -- and pointing out that Glass is currently a prototype, not a finished product.

Fair enough, but the mere fact that Google needs to play damage control confirms that the tenor of the discussion around Google Glass has changed, and not for the better. The excitement surrounding Sergey Brin's daring Glass-inspired skydiving stunt at Google I/O 2012 is a distant memory. Glass in 2014 has become an emblem for technology's worst stereotypes: ultra-geeky, expensive and -- worst of all -- privacy-destroying.

The Fashion Factor

The first mistake Google made with Glass came before anyone even knew about it. A key decision was made in the production of Glass -- that it should stand out, not blend in. Sure, a connected headset requires something a little bulkier than your typical Warby Parker frames, but Google decided to: a) use an odd asymmetrical design, and b) offer it in five colors.

If an Explorer selects either ""sky"" or ""tangerine,"" Glass doesn't just stand out. It screams.

Glass earned unfavorable comparisons to other weird-looking tech. Well-known industrial designer Marc Newson recently said he wouldn't be caught dead wearing it, complaining Glass makes the user look like a ""complete dick"" in the same way the Segway did. ""That's precisely the moment when I think the fashion world laughs at the world of industrial design, justifiably,"" he told Dezeen(Opens in a new window).

Giving Glass a touch of flamboyance was understandable; every manufacturer wants its signature products to get noticed. The design guaranteed Glass would turn heads -- but it also ensured no one could be neutral about it. The future was here, sitting on someone's face, and it was instantly on trial: You either were intrigued and enthralled by the potential of an always-connected headset, or -- like Neil Gaiman -- you just thought it looked very, very silly.

""The design itself isn't bad,"" Evan Ryan, an industrial designer with Ecco, told Mashable, ""but it doesn't look right as a thing you wear every day. It doesn't even look within the realm of some of the outlandish fashion styles you might see in New York City.""

The ostentatious design had a secondary effect: It ensured Glass's earliest ambassadors would be people who wanted to be noticed. These aren't the soccer moms and guitarists we saw in the earliest promo videos(Opens in a new window) for Glass, sharing clips and getting directions to the nearest cool food truck. No, the people introducing Glass to the world are digital marketers, consultants and bloggers -- people more likely to use Glass for a reality show(Opens in a new window) or advertising campaign(Opens in a new window) than logging their everyday moments.

This was confirmed to me when I attended a Google Glass Explorer meetup in New York City last fall. Looking to get developers' impressions of Glass, I instead got a cavalcade of self-promotional characters, each weirder than the last. When an ambitious teenager with excruciatingly bad breath tried to tell me he wanted to become the first person to win political office with a Glass-powered campaign, I didn't know whether to laugh, or laugh really loudly.

""Any obsession can be blinding, and with technology the idea of becoming superhuman can be very intoxicating,"" says Jonas Damon, a designer with frog design. ""Being under the spell of this promise, we forget how obtrusive a chunky piece of hardware on our heads can be. That person sees non-stop access to data. That is the person who wears Google Glass.""

Recruiting some epically bad ambassadors for Glass was Google's next mistake. The company did it via the #IfIHadGlass campaign. This seemed like a genius move at the time: get people to tell you how they'd use Glass, then send headsets to the ones who make the most promising and creative suggestions.

""The goal of #IfIHadGlass was to get Glass into the hands of people from all walks of life,"" Ed Sanders, Google's director of marketing for Google Glass, told Mashable. ""Sure, there have been some controversial moments, and you can choose to focus on those few, but there are thousands of Explorers out there and, broadly speaking, we've been amazed and inspired by them. This is exactly what we were after when we started the Explorer program and we haven't been disappointed.""

From the looks of things at that meetup, however, Google may as well have used the hashtag #WeirdosUnite. Having a creative idea about Google Glass isn't the same as executing it, and it certainly doesn't guarantee an appropriate ambassadorial personality. Google correctly points out that not everyone is doing a Google Glass reality show, and that many developers are doing worthwhile and technically impressive things with the device.

But standing out from the crowd is part of the deal, and a large number of Glass Explorers clearly see the device as a $1,500 ticket to notoriety.

Developing long

Google has certainly given Glass users enough time to get noticed. The device itself was unveiled in spring 2012. The company sent out its first units in April 2013. A year later, the commercial release of Google Glass is still nowhere on the horizon (officially there's no release date, although Brin has said in interviews that 2014 is the target).

According to Google, this was the plan all along. ""We had two choices: design Glass in a secret conference room somewhere with zero input from the outside world, or design it in the open with the help from our Explorers and the wider public,"" Sanders said. ""We believe the latter is the right approach because it gives us the opportunity to build a device that reflects how people use it in the real world.

""Gmail was in beta for years as engineers worked to make it a fantastic email platform. This phase of Glass can be messy and imperfect, but the final result in the long term is worth it.""

The Gmail comparison works up to a point. Unlike Gmail, Glass is also a new category -- one that forces questions about social acceptance and privacy. It's also in limited supply, and you have to pay $1,500 for the privilege even if you score an invite. Gmail's beta was free, and invites were much easier to come by -- every Gmail user started with 99 of them. It also wasn't something you could wear on a date.

The privacy concerns around Glass aren't baseless. Although the camera technology of Glass is no different from a smartphone's, the fact that the camera rests on your face changes everything. The first question most people ask when they approach me about Glass is: ""are you recording me?""

The Toluna Group, a market research firm, recently surveyed consumer reactions to Glass in multiple countries. The survey of 3,000 people (some results below) found that fears about private actions becoming public in the presence of Google Glass was a common theme, and that many people -- 69% of respondents in the U.K. -- were concerned about what Glass meant for privacy.

""There are a lot of cameras out there,"" says Bob Gellman, a Washington, D.C.-based privacy consultant. ""But being photographed by individuals is kind of a different thing ... it's not some screaming violation of everything, but it's the difference between talking to a reporter on the record or off the record. When the camera's on, you're on the record all the time, whether you know it or not.""

Putting the camera in full view on a garish gadget was supposed to quell any fears about Glass as a privacy-violating device. It has actually had the opposite effect. Google made Glass the only digital camera left that doesn't use(Opens in a new window) facial-recognition technology, but even that hasn't silenced the critical voices of privacy advocates.

""A lot of people donâ€™t recognize Google Glass and donâ€™t necessarily know what its capabilities are,"" says Gellman. ""Whatever they are, they could easily become less transparent as the technology gets better and smaller. I think the word that applies here is 'creepy.'""

Those concerns have been exacerbated by the fact that Glass is still only in the hands of around 10,000 people. Even now, a year after the launch and two years after it was first unveiled, many people still regard Glass as spyware, and at least one developer has obliged them by creating an app(Opens in a new window) that offers no indication when Glass is taking photos. Australia is even thinking of overhauling its privacy laws(Opens in a new window) in the wake of Glass.

This is a perfect illustration of the bind Google finds itself in. Misinformation and exaggerated reports would be easier to shoot down if Glass were a real product, with millions of units in circulation. But Google is clearly tiptoeing here, not so much testing whether Glass is ready for customers but whether society is ready for Glass.

Google has already been dinged over privacy (and now has the FTC looking over its shoulder for the next two decades). It has inadvertently annoyed various industries for making wrongheaded assumptions about major products (such as Google TV, which irritated content providers). Having learned its lessons, Google is being particularly careful with the Glass rollout.

Perhaps too careful. The excruciatingly long timeframe is allowing critics, and incidents like the bar assault, to take hold of the product's narrative. For every firefighter(Opens in a new window) or doctor(Opens in a new window) who does something innovative with Glass, someone is pulled over while driving with the device, or gets thrown out of a movie theater and interrogated by the FBI(Opens in a new window) for wearing it.

Google may have made the right decision in developing Glass in public, but the conspicuous design, the #IfIHadGlass campaign and the excruciatingly long road to a consumer launch were all self-inflicted wounds.

A new pane dawns

There's still time to make this right. Google's deal with Luxottica -- tying the device to a well-known consumer eyewear brand -- is a step in the right direction. Getting Ray-Ban to make frames for Google Glass doesn't nullify privacy issues, but it does increase the desirability factor.

Another good step would be to better control who's actually getting Glass pre-launch. Google needs to give out memberships to the Glass club in a manner more like El Al Airlines, and less like Oprah (""And you get a Glass! And you get a Glass!""). Let's have no more consultants, reality show creators or wannabe politicians; not until everyone can buy it.

Credit: Mashable

Even better, more Google personnel should be advocates for Glass. Robert Scoble criticized Larry Page when he appeared recently at TED for not wearing Glass, and it's hard not to see his point. If Glass really does improve someone's digital life and look stylish, why isn't Google's own CEO wearing it?

Defenders might say the device isn't appropriate all the time, but at some point this lack of visibility on Google's most visible faces starts to come across as a lack of confidence.

Finally, Google should rethink the design -- particularly its initial decision to make Glass conspicuous. That made the device a lightning rod for privacy fears, and ensured only a self-selecting few would take part in Google's head-mounted wearable adventure.

True, Glass that looks more like a regular pair of glasses may garner more criticism from privacy advocates. But anyone actually interested in the benefits of the technology would breathe a sigh of relief, knowing they wouldn't necessarily have to act as an ambassador every time they put them on in public. Maybe even Neil Gaiman would try them.

""The design of Glass has changed many times in the last two years and it will continue to change,"" Sanders said. ""Two years ago it was a couple of cell phone boards hot-glue-gunned to wireframe glasses. Today, it weighs about as much as a pair of sunglasses. And with Luxottica onboard, Explorers can expect even more design choices in the months ahead.""

To be completely clear, I really like Google Glass. I usually wear it when I play with my kids to ensure I capture wonderful, fleeting moments without needing to aim or focus anything with my hands. I wear it in public often. I like talking to people about it and, if there's time, showing them the benefits of a connected headset.

And the benefits are many. Seeing messages -- but only essential ones -- the instant they come in keeps me in the loop with people I care about. Having voice-activated access to Google anytime, anywhere has let me get answers to quick questions, the kind I'd never have bothered to pull out my smartphone to ask. The way it does turn-by-turn directions is a dream, especially in the car.

However, as much as I'd like to dismiss the bars that have banned Glass, the FBI agents who detained the man who wore Glass to a movie theater, and the gentleman who yelled at me on the street as paranoid cranks, I have to admit their concerns have some merit. Google Glass looks weird, a lot of weirdos are wearing it, and there's that camera.

Google has to change the conversation, and fast. If it doesn't, the promise of Google Glass -- and other smart glasses like it -- will probably be eclipsed by smartwatches, which are experiencing a surge in interest. If Apple's rumored iWatch is available to consumers before Glass, Google is going to have a much harder time convincing people that they should experience on their faces the same sort of thing that looks more stylish on their wrists.

Smart glasses still have a shot at becoming mainstream wearable technology. If Google really wants Glass to be part of our future, it needs to put on its connected headset and lead.

7013959,WTF Is HFT? What You Should Know About High-Frequency Trading,"If you've scratched your head this week about all the talk around high-frequency trading, you're not alone.

High-frequency trading, a practice that has become increasingly common in recent years, has gained more mainstream attention thanks in large part to Michael Lewis, the author of popular books like Moneyball and The Big Short. His new book, released Monday, is called Flash Boys(Opens in a new window) and takes a critical look at the risks of high-speed trading. It has already sparked some heated debates, as you can see in the incredible CNBC video below.

At the same time, the FBI recently confirmed(Opens in a new window) that it is looking into the practice of high-speed trading to determine whether traders are breaking the law by having access to non-public information.

To help explain what high-frequency trading is, how we got to this point and why the government is taking notice, we reached out to Charles Jones, a finance professor at Columbia Business School. Here is a lightly edited transcript of that conversation.

Mashable: First things first: Can you give us a brief explainer on how high-frequency trading works?

Jones: It's a computer program that is programmed to trade in and out of stocks pretty quickly, with holding periods measured usually in seconds to minutes, rather than in days and weeks. These guys are doing a couple of different things: They are the new market makers. They are willing to buy and hold onto the shares for a few minutes until they can find another buyer who wants to hold it longer term. They are also often trading on small imperfections where prices aren't exactly the same in two markets.

So how did we get to this point where we can speed up and automate trades?

We've been transitioning from manual markets with trading floors and people to automated markets where it's basically a computer server somewhere in suburban New Jersey. That process has been going on for really the last 10-15 years. More or less, the computers won, and when the computers won, everybody had to revamp all their processes to deal with the new ecosystem.

So that's why the high-frequency trading program has replaced the floor trader on the floor of the stock exchange. An algorithm for a pension fund for it to place its orders has replaced a broker who would spend all day to slowly buy 100,000 shares.

Who are the big players here? Would the average person even recognize the names?

All the exchanges have embraced it. The real changing of the guard here is that it used to be dominated by large Wall Street firms and their trading desks. They have been supplanted by these newer companies that are more technology companies than they are Wall Street companies. The players now are mostly names that people have never heard of: Companies like Getco, companies like Citadel [Group], companies like Tradeworx. These are typically small technology shops that have very fast hardware and good code.

What is the strongest case in favor of the practice of high-speed trading?

If we replace a lot of humans with computer code, we are going to be able to do that cheaper. It's wringing costs out of the system, and when you wring costs out of the system you can basically provide the same services to investors at lower costs... The pro case, especially if you are a retail trader, is you are actually a lot better off now because these guys are able to provide liquidity at lower cost. You will never pay more than a penny extra a share in markup. Now commissions are $7.95, or some number like that, for any size trade. The technology squeezes the cost out and the competition squeezes the profit out and the investor benefits.

And what is the case against it?

The con case is really that it's possible the markets are more fragile than they were before -- that because it's all computers talking to each other and the quality control isn't always there, we are prone to maybe more breakdowns than before. There have been a few high-profile examples(Opens in a new window) of that.

The FBI is currently looking into high-frequency trading. The SEC had previously proposed regulations. What's going on here?

I think it's clear that HFT has a serious perception problem even if perception is worse than the reality. So I think these guys are responding to that. Given the outcry and worry by some investors, it probably makes sense to look more closely and make sure there isn't any there there.

The new Michael Lewis book has certainly helped propel the issue more into the mainstream. What, if anything, do you expect will come from that?

I think what it means is this is elevating the discussion. It will elevate the importance of these policy issues. The SEC might not have been too keen to have looked at the overall U.S. market structure, but you can be damn sure they are going to now... My guess is that that's going to happen before 2014 is out.",4/1/2014 0:00,0.452484,62,3,1,4.536511,4,Entertainment,3249.933,11625,5546.815,2627,0.567164,0.135045,0.032454,0.016227,0.7,-0.4,24700

A nine year story came to an end Monday night during the How I Met Your Mother series finale. There were laughs. There were tears. But most of all, there were a lot of angry fans.

The two-part episode, ""Last Forever"", confirmed HIMYM fans' worst fears: that The Mother would be dead by the end of the series. The unexpected, and yet completely expected, twist at the end is that the mother was merely a pawn in the grand scheme of bringing Ted back together with the real love of his life -- Robin.

A gray-haired Ted Mosby finally finished telling his two children the story about their mom during Monday night's How I Met Your Mother series finale. But what the kids said in response was filmed nearly a decade ago -- and kept secret ever since.

Lyndsy Fonseca and David Henrie, the actors who played Ted's kids, Penny and Luke, shot their scenes for this finale in 2005, around the same time the series premiered.

[seealso slug=""how-i-met-your-mother-barney-stinson-suits/""]

""That's it? No, I don't buy it,"" Penny said in the waning minutes of the finale. ""That is not the reason you made us listen to this. Let's look at the facts here: You made us sit down and listen to this story about how you met mom, but mom is hardly in the story.""

""No. This is a story about how you're totally in love with aunt Robin and you're thinking about asking her out and you want to know if we're ok with it,"" Penny continued. ""Come on, dad. Mom has been gone for six years now. It's time.""

His kids' approval gained, Ted then ran out to express his love to Robin, using the french blue horn from the series' pilot.

Following in the footsteps of ASCII art, users now have the ability to post up to four photos in one post. Twitter calls this a ""Photo Collage."" We call it wicked fun.

But how do you make a collage, and then once you know how, what collages are best? Consider this your step-by-step guide to an eye-popping collage masterpiece (or at least something that makes your friends laugh).

First, you need to make sure you have the latest version of Twitter for iPhone: That would be 6.3. Sorry, there's no support on Android or Twitter.com for now.

Twitter Catch Collage. pic.twitter.com/jDIN3jDKDk(Opens in a new window)

â€” Lance Ulanoff (@LanceUlanoff) April 1, 2014(Opens in a new window)

Twitter collages will, when complete, appear as a four-square grid on the iPhone and Twitter.com, but as a series of vertical photos in TweetDeck. The grid design introduces a number of tantalizing possibilities. You can, for example, plan a set of photos that are linked together. Maybe the action starts in one photo and continues from one to the next, like the one above. Let's see how I created it.

If you want your four collage photos to work together, you'll need to do a little planning. For ours, we thought it might be fun to have Mashable intern Brian Koeber play catch with himself.

You'll notice that Twitter.com and Twitter for iPhone significantly crop the top and bottom of the photos, so you'll need to keep your subjects in the center of the frame. The edges are not cropped, so you can ""connect"" photos that way.

To see your tweet draft again, you'll need to hold and drag down on the image gallery. Unfortunately, Twitter does not show you a preview of your collage. Instead, you only see the first two images in the draft tweet. If you post your tweet, you'll see an image link, but your followers will see your collage. If they tap on it, they see the first full photo and then can click or gesture from right to left to see the rest of the images.

The company would say the accelerated schedule represents the way of the world now, with rapid-fire updates and a near-constant churn of new apps and services. ""Move fast and break things,"" is much more than just a Facebook slogan these days.

But in Microsoft's case there's more to it than that. The company is playing both catch-up and damage control. Its smartphone and tablet platforms came later than its competitors' and the bold strategy surrounding touch-friendly Windows 8 (and later 8.1) didn't really work out as planned. PC sales have continued to slide and most of the people who led that launch have left the company.

Not to mention there's a new man at the top. Nadella, who replaced the polarizing Steve Ballmer, will kick off the proceedings in the opening day keynote Wednesday morning. With this crowd, though, it's not a big leap: Nadella has led the Day 2 keynote for the past few years, and he'll be in his element in front of an audience of developers, most of whom are as in love with the cloud as he is.

But this time, as CEO, Nadella is also playing to a mainstream crowd, too. The company may be making reams of cash, but its influence on everyday ""computing"" is still on the wane. He'll need to convince observers that Microsoft can fix its platform issues while exciting them about what's still to come.

Here's what some of that might entail.

Windows 8.1 Update

Microsoft's most substantive announcement, the Windows 8.1 Update, has already leaked. It includes many new features, almost all of them to improve the experience for mouse-and-keyboard setups. The desktop, and the taskbar, regain their prominence on those machines, and the default setting boots the user into the desktop.

The changes represent what will probably be the last, and most essential, course correction on the path Microsoft embarked on with Windows 8. From the start the OS was criticized for going too far with touch Windows on traditional machines, where the user would typically spend the most time in the desktop anyway. The changes might not silence all the critics, but it may win over a few more upgrades, particularly among Microsoft's crucial business customers.

Windows upgrade for free?

In March, a rumor circulated that Microsoft may offer a version of Windows 8.1 that would be a free download for users running Windows 7 or earlier. The catch would be that the software would be powered, if not sponsored, by Bing. It's unclear exactly how that would work, but Amazon's ad-supported Kindles may provide the template.

However, there's a chance that the rumor is just that. Although a screenshot surfaced of a PC running ""Windows 8.1 With Bing,"" it's possible it was just an experiment, or meant something else entirely.

Office for touch Windows preview

Microsoft unveiled Office for iPad last week, and at that event Nadella said the company would have more to say about Office on other platforms at Build. A version of Office that runs in the Modern/Metro environment made a closed-door appearance at last year's conference, but there are big technical leaps to actually convert it, which is why the current version still runs in the desktop.

Most likely we'll see a preview and possibly a release date for Touch Office, but not much more. If Modern Office was close to launch, Microsoft probably would have released it with the iPad version.

Windows Phone moves forward

The last Windows Phone update gave the platform phablets, and the next one -- said to be called Windows Phone 8.1 -- will give it a voice assistant, according to leaks(Opens in a new window). Codenamed ""Cortana,"" the update will put Windows Phone in the same league as iOS and Android, which have had sophisticated voice control for years.

Also rumored to be part of the update: VPN support, Internet Explorer 11 and an overhauled camera interface. The first phones may hit as early as late April. By then, Nokia may even be officially part of Microsoft.

Azure, Bing and OneDrive

The unsung heroes of Build have always been Microsoft's services, but now they'll likely get some extra play for a couple of reasons: First, Nadella has put the cloud front and center in Microsoft's game plan. And second, they're actually pretty good these days.

After a slight rebranding, Microsoft's Azure cloud now matches Amazon Web Services' pricing. OneDrive, the most public-facing service, is now intimately tied with Windows, and the tools it offers -- such as cheap cloud storage and real-time collaboration -- work well. And Bing's data continues to spread to more apps since Microsoft opened it up to developers last year.

Surface Mini

When Microsoft refreshed its Surface lineup last fall, something was missing: a small-size tablet. Windows 8.1 enables smaller form factors, and several have appeared on the market since its release. Will Microsoft's house ""mini"" tablet finally arrive at Build?

Rumors(Opens in a new window) say the Surface Mini will get its big unveiling at the conference, and that may happen, but considering the lack of substantive leaks, the release date will probably be later in the year, possibly the summer.

Sings of Windows 9

With the Windows 8.1 Update, Microsoft takes Windows 8 about as far as it can go in terms of pleasing critics. It's also been about a year and a half since its initial release -- the halfway point, if the previous two versions of Windows, Vista and 7, are any indication.

Microsoft has certainly begun work on ""Windows 9,"" or whatever it ends up being called, but it's still a bit early for any major announcements. Windows 8 made its official pubic appearance at the summer Computex show in Taiwan in 2011, and that was still a very early look. Microsoft may repeat that pattern, or it may hold another event in the fall, assuming it keeps the same three-year schedule.

Could mining

That doesn't mean we won't get hints of where the company is going with all this. Among all the product announcements, Nadella will set a tone and lay out a vision for what Microsoft will do -- and more important, what it will represent to technology -- in the coming years.

Where Steve Ballmer saw ""devices and services,"" Nadella sees ""cloud and mobile."" It's basically the same thing, but subtly different (note the order of the terms). Nadella's Microsoft puts new emphasis on the power of our devices to connect us -- to apps, data, media and the wonders emerging from minds of Silicon Valley and beyond.

It sounds straightforward, but it's the most challenging thing, and that goes double for Microsoft, since it needs to get its house in order while simultaneously building a new one to better serve this connected future. Can it do both? We'll have a better idea by the end of the week.",4/1/2014 0:00,0.413987,4,2,0,4.333856,5,Tech,2792.699,4717.931,3610.095,2000,0.485245,0.170378,0.044671,0.013323,0,0,1100

But this is a popularity contest, and the votes are all coming from social media. Now who would win? Weâ€™ll soon find out.

SEE ALSO: MTV Announces the 2014 Movie Award Nominations

MTV is announcing an all-new category for the 2014 Movie Awards: Favorite character. The throw-down also marks the third campaign to exclusively use hashtag counts on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and Vine to determine the winner.

For the past two years, MTV used social media to determine another new category, Best Hero. Thatâ€™s now part of the MTV Movie Awardsâ€™ stable of regular categories (and this year it's between John Cale in White House Down, Thor, Superman, Bilbo Baggins and Iron Man).

MTV moved the Best Hero category into its online voting structure after a mighty leap in social popularity -- from 810,334 hashtag votes in its inaugural 2012 to 3,320,338 votes last year. â€œSocial correspondentsâ€ Our 2nd Life â€“ think of them as a boy band for social media instead of music â€“ will announce the new category later Tuesday, when voting gets under way.

(By the way, superfans, those hashtags are: #votekatniss, #votetris, #voteveronicamars, #voteloki and #votekhan.)

MTV took some heat during the â€œTwilightâ€ years, as the franchiseâ€™s rabid fanbase stuffed the ballot box to be sure Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson kept circulating onstage. Things have evened out since, though MTV will still count as many votes as fans are willing to throw up on their feeds.

â€œWe kind of like the horse-race that it creates,â€ Colin Helms, SVP of Connected Content for MTV, told Mashable. â€œAs you get closer to the show, the velocity picks up.â€

Fans are also enticed to add photos and videos of themselves with their art, costumes, personal messages or whatever else theyâ€™re inspired to do. Though each original hashtag still only counts as one vote, the best stuff will be featured on www.MovieAwards.MTV.com(Opens in a new window).

â€œWeâ€™re scraping any images posted with the hashtag, so youâ€™ll not only see whoâ€™s leading, but also see any content thatâ€™s being created around that character,â€ Helms said.

7025165,Looking Back on a Decade of Gmail,"I still remember where I was when I first heard about Gmail. It was April 1, 2004 and I was at my parents house, recovering from having my wisdom teeth removed. At 21, and finishing my third year of college, most of my recovery consisted of listening to my iPod (a 20GB third-generation model) and browsing the Internet. If you replace LiveJournal with Tumblr, Slashdot with Reddit and Hacker News and Gawker with, well, Gawker, the open tabs in my browser (Firefox 0.8 in 2004, Google Chrome today) aren't that different.

Gmail was the news story that day. I remembering discussing it in IMs with friends and on LiveJournal. Google -- a company we then only knew as a search engine -- was launching its own mail service, and it was going to give 1GB of storage to all users, for free. Because of this extraordinary claim, and because it launched on April 1, many of us thought it might be a hoax.

It's important to remember the state of free webmail as it existed in 2004. Hotmail gave users 2MB of storage. That's not a typo. Yahoo was a little better -- offering 4MB or 6MB, depending on when you signed up. Moreover, those services had fairly strict login requirements. If you didn't check your mail within a certain number of days, all of it was deleted and gone forever.

Most serious email users either used whatever account came with their ISP, or hooked their webmail account to client software like Outlook or Apple Mail. That worked fine, but meant that most users could only access email on one machine. I could check my email on my laptop, but unless I had my POP settings configured just right, it wouldn't sync up with my inbox. If you had a smartphone -- I had a Treo 600 in 2004 -- that was yet another hurdle (or another email address).

Gmail was radically different. Google's mantra was that you would have enough space to never need to delete email ever again. The design of Gmail was different too. Rather than putting stuff in folders, you applied tags. You searched rather than filing things away. Messages were displayed as conversations and threads, rather than individual messages.

This seems obvious now, as good ideas usually do. But in April 2004, it was a brand new way to think about email. As Harry McCracken notes in his history of Gmail(Opens in a new window), the launch of Gmail marks the birth of the modern web.

The allure of the invite

Everyone in my circle of friends wanted access to Gmail. But to ensure that the product could scale appropriately, Google limited its rollout. To get an account early on, you needed an invite. To get an invite, you needed to be in the technology media or know someone at Google.

As Google knew, one of the side-benefits of scaling in a controlled way was that it created a greater sense of demand.

Just hours after Google issued a press releasing announcing Gmail, invites became the ultimate score for tech aficionados such as myself. Trading forums popped up, invites made their way onto eBay (at least until eBay blocked invite sales), and in an era before Facebook extended past the Ivy League, tech savvy users scoured their networks to try to find a way in.

I knew a few people at Google, but none of them well enough to bug for an invite. Fortunately, my friend Ryan had a good friend at Google, and he managed to score an invite the day Gmail launched. After continuous prodding, Ryan was able to send me an invite a few days later.

On April 3, 2004, I created my account and logged in for the first time.

The age of ads

Ten years later, it would be easy to look back on the Gmail launch as a smashing success. Indeed, in many ways it was. The product itself was remarkably well built. It went on to really define the idea of a web app, proved that AJAX would not only work, but would be the future, and helped define Google as more than just a search company.

Still, Gmail faced criticism as soon as it launched. Gmail launched with ads -- but not just any ads, contextual ads generated in part by the contents of your email.

Google released AdSense in 2003. By 2004 it was starting to make itself at home across the web. The genius of Gmail was that it would apply AdSense technology to the content of a user's inbox. Google was quick to point out that humans never read the messages, and the matching of ads to content was ""performed entirely by computers; never by people.""

Still, privacy advocates were on high alert. Within the first week of Gmail's launch, petitions were written, lawsuits were threatened, and it seemed like the issue might kill Gmail in its crib. Writing for Slate in April 2004(Opens in a new window), Paul Boutin came out against Gmail critics, arguing that the privacy fears were silly, but he also acknowledged that not handling them correctly could cost the company dearly.

""They may be forced to abandon the best Web mail system yet because of a few well-placed people who've never even tried it,"" he wrote. ""That really would be evil.""

It turned out Boutin had nothing to fear. Most users just didn't care. I remember discussing the Gmail privacy issue with friends in the first few weeks the service was available. The algorithmic nature of Gmail's ad platform put many of us at ease. Others were willing to accept a potential lack of privacy in exchange for a free service that was so much better than anything else in web email.

Still, what ultimately reassured all of us -- even those with bigger-picture concerns -- was the fact that we trusted Google. We trusted Google to do the right thing by its users and to respect our privacy. In April 2004, four months before it went public, Google was the tech company I most admired. In a tech world still battered from the scars of the dotcom crash, Google seemed fresh and clean and futuristic.

It's interesting to see just how long that lasted. For years, I predicted a Google backlash -- if only because of the sheer amount of data the company was collecting. And yet it took until 2010, with the bungled launch of Google Buzz, for the narrative around Google to shift.

Even now, in 2014, when Google's mammoth cache of user data and analytics is second only to the NSA, sentiment around the company is largely positive. I no longer see Google as the ideal tech company -- frankly, aspects of the company and its products creep me out -- but I still use Google services every single day.

A decade later, I don't have the same trust that Google will do the right thing by its users, but I still trust that it won't make decisions out of malice.

7033555,Obamacare Hits 7.1 Million -- Thank Zach Galifianakis?,"Open enrollment on Healthcare.gov for the Affordable Care Act is over, and President Barack Obama said the number of signups has reached the White House's goal of 7.1 million -- despite a slew of glitches on the website.

The president addressed those problems from the Rose Garden on Tuesday afternoon.

â€œThe lawâ€™s not perfect,"" Obama said. ""Weâ€™ve had to make adjustments along the way. The implementation, especially with the website, has had its share of problems.""

Issues started in October when the website couldn't handle a modest amount of traffic after it launched, which caused more than a month's worth of glitches and delays. More issues sprung up Monday--the final day of open enrollment--shutting down the site for around six hours(Opens in a new window) and restricting users from creating new accounts for about 60 minutes.

But Obama also said that problems with the site are no longer relevant when it comes to the law's effectiveness.

â€œPress, I want you to anticipate, there will be some moment when the website is down, and it will be on all your front pages,"" Obama said. ""Itâ€™s gonna happen. It wonâ€™t be news.â€

Those problems have indeed taken a backseat to high enrollment numbers that may have stemmed from Obama's recent push to get young people to sign up. The president even plugged his healthcare law on ""Between Two Ferns,"" the online Funny or Die comedy series hosted by Zach Galifianakis.

In an interview with Huffington Post Live on Monday, U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius said they definitely saw a ""Galifianakis bump(Opens in a new window)"" in enrollment traffic after the president appeared on the show.

""The website traffic surged once the 'Between Two Ferns' interview went on,"" Sebelius said on the show. Later, she added, ""As a mother of two 30-something sons, I know they're more likely to get their information on Funny or Die than they are on network TV.""

Vice President Joe Biden also did his part when he appeared on the Rachael Ray Show Monday to talk about the Affordable Care Act.

The push to get young people to sign up is key to the law's success(Opens in a new window) because money garnered from young people may offset what it costs to provide healthcare for older and unhealthy Americans.

Though the website closed its enrollment as of midnight on April 1, it will soon reopen to anyone who had started but not finished enrolling. For anyone who did not begin the process, the next open enrollment starts on Nov. 15.

In fact, the Target partnership marks the first time Pebble has sold the arctic white variant of its smartwatch in retail stores. Pebble says that this is a Target exclusive(Opens in a new window) for a limited time.

Target isn't the first retailer to carry Pebble in stores. Last July, it became available in Best Buy stores. AT&T stores started carrying the Pebble last fall. That retail presence -- which also includes GetPebble.com and Amazon -- helped Pebble sell 400,000 smartwatches in 2013.

The target partnership helps Pebble position the smartwatch as more of a mainstream gadget and device. As I've remarked before, I see far more fitness trackers around than I do smartwatches. Being available at a store like Target -- that caters to the general consumer rather than the early adopter -- Pebble is making a play to be a more mainstream accessory.

Jackson, who was born and resides in New Zealand, is best known for directing movies such as the Lord of the Rings trilogy.

But his $80 million Gulfstream G650(Opens in a new window) flies faster and can travel farther than any plane flown by the Royal New Zealand Air Force. It has a top speed of 708 miles per hour and can cover a distance of 8,053 miles before it has to refuel, according to The Dominion Post. This allows Jackson to travel nonstop from his home in Welllington, New Zealand to Los Angeles, California, where much of his filmmaking work takes place.

And so Jackson has reportedly allowed his jet, which he purchased in March 2013, to join the search for the missing plane, helping to relay communications for other aircraft that are a part of the search.

The plane is part of an international effort to find the Boeing 777 that went missing on March 8. Authorities believe the plane's journey ended somewhere in the southern Indian Ocean, and have focused their search around an area 1,150 miles off the coast of Perth, Australia.

7013564,SmartGlass Is Now a Universal Remote for Xbox One,"The Xbox One's entertainment control features are coming to its second screen Smartglass app, and some users will get the update Tuesday, Microsoft announced in a blog post(Opens in a new window).

The Xbox One's OneGuide, which allows users to pick shows and movies from both live television and their subscribed video-on-demand apps while on the console, is rolling out through SmartGlass on tablets and phones. After users launch SmartGlass on an iOS, Android or Windows device, they can pick from selections on television imported by their cable provider, browse their Hulu Plus queue or see the most recent channels they've watched.

The SmartGlass version of OneGuide can also mimic some functions of a universal remote, controlling the television, cable or satellite set-top box and the Xbox One.

Xbox Director of Programming Larry Hryb and head of Xbox TV Ben Smith previewed some of the features in a video released Tuesday, playable above. Some Xbox Live users will start seeing the features on Tuesday, and it will slowly roll out across the United States, Canada and Europe as the Xbox team collects feedback, Smith said.

This update will also deliver OneGuide to the Xbox One in countries where it was not previously available, such as the UK, Canada, France and Germany.

7013619,Snow Survey Reveals Depth of California's Water Woes,"After its third-driest winter on record, driest calendar year and third straight year of below-average precipitation, California water officials were no doubt bracing for bad news when they set out to conduct a statewide snow survey high in the Sierra Nevada Mountain range on April 1. The snow survey is seen as a key marker of the health of the state's water supplies, since it typically marks the peak snow cover for the season.

Snow surveyors found a snowpack on Tuesday that contains just 32% of the average water content typically observed at this time of year, which places 2014 as among the lowest water-content years on record since such records began in 1930.

The low water content, combined with unusually low reservoir levels, means that the country's most populous state faces a long and stressful dry season ahead, with farmers and their thirsty crops competing with urban residents for access to increasingly scarce supplies. The California agriculture industry is the largest of any state in the U.S., generating about $45 billion in annual revenue, and the drought is projected to hit farmers especially hard.

""We're already seeing farmland fallowed and cities scrambling for water supplies,"" Mark Cowin, director of the California Department of Water Resources, said in a statement. ""We can hope that conditions improve, but time is running out, and conservation is the only tool we have against nature's whim.""

California has been mired in a historic drought for more than a year, part of a broader multi-year drought that is also affecting other states in the west. It had its warmest and third-driest winter on record, which intensified the preexisting drought following the state's driest calendar year on record in 2013. As of March 25, all of California was in some form of drought condition, with ""exceptional drought"" gripping about 23% of the state.

The drought is the most severe one-year drought on record in California, even more severe than the 1976-77 drought. To find a comparable drought, you have to go back to events that took place before instrument records began in the late 19th century.

""Snowpack measurement on April 1 is often considered a key measure of where we are,"" Peter Gleick, president of the Oakland-based environmental-research group Pacific Institute, told reporters on a conference call. â€œBy any measures, our snowpack is low.""

Recent storms have helped boost California's water supplies slightly, and forecasts show additional wet weather is possible(Opens in a new window) in parts of the state during the next two weeks. However, precipitation on a scale that would be required to end the drought is not likely until next fall or winter.

Electronic readings from the California Department of Water Resources found that the central parts of the Sierra Nevada have the most snow, with snowpack water content 38% of normal. This compares to 23% of average for the northern mountains and 31% of normal for the south.

Runoff from mountain snowpack contributes about one-third of California's water supply, with the rest coming from reservoirs or piped in from out-of-state. According to the World Resources Institute, a Washington think tank, California draws water from 157 million acres of land across eight states.

Making matters worse, reservoirs are also running far below average levels for this time of year -- another sign of the water stress that California will grapple with this summer.

Lake Oroville in Butte County, which is the State Water Project's largest reservoir, is at only 49% of its capacity. And San Luis Reservoir, which contributes water to the State Water Project(Opens in a new window) and the Central Valley Project(Opens in a new window), is at just 42% of its capacity, the Department of Water Resources said.

Responding to the drought conditions, water suppliers -- including the state -- have been slashing their promised deliveries. On Jan. 1, the State Water Project, which supplies supplemental water to nearly 25 million Californians and 750,000 acres of irrigated farmland, set its water delivery estimate at zero, which -- if it remains at that level -- would be the first time that has happened in the 54-year history of the project. In addition, the Department of Water Resources also said it planned to reduce allocations to farmland by 50%, the maximum extent allowable by law.

Santa Clara Valley Water District, which supplies water for much of Silicon Valley, has instituted a mandatory reduction in water use to 20% below 2013 levels, after a series of water-delivery cutbacks from state and federal agencies.

The role of climate change in the current drought is complicated, since natural variability in the climate system has brought more severe and far longer-lasting droughts to the west in the past. However, a new report from the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and other data show that increased temperatures help dry out soils faster and melt more snow, thereby acting as a drought amplifier.

â€œWe know that climate change is contributing to the current drought,â€ Pacific Institute's Gleick said. â€œClimate change now influences extreme events and will continue to do so.â€",4/1/2014 0:00,0.568733,20,16,3,4.516883,10,00000,0,6609.296,3790.79,51700,0.466554,0.034109,0.028571,0.01039,0,0,474
7033451,Mark Your Calendar for Spring Meteor Showers and Eclipses,"From eclipses and planets to meteor showers galore, the northern spring season of 2014 will bring a number of eye-catching celestial sights for stargazers on Earth.

Weather permitting, some of the best spring night sky events(Opens in a new window) could be readily visible without the aid of binoculars or a telescope(Opens in a new window), even from brightly-lit cities. But you'll need to know when and where to look to make the most of the season.

I've always felt that many astronomers started their careers as perceptive children who responded to the thrill of witnessing a noteworthy astronomical event. So whether you want to impress a youngster, or you're simply hoping to witness a head-turning astronomical event for yourself, it always helps to be ready in advance by marking your calendar and highlighting a number of these special dates:

April 14 and 15: Mars' closest approach in 2014 and a total eclipse of the moon

During the overnight hours of April 14 and 15, it will be a night for viewing first Mars and later the full moon.

First, Mars will come to within 57.4 million miles of our planet, making its closest approach to us since Jan. 3, 2008. All through the night, Mars will resemble a dazzling star shining with a steady fiery-colored tint making it a formidable sight; its brightness will match Sirius, the brightest of all the stars.

As a bonus, later that very same night (actually during the early hours of April 15) North America will have a ringside seat to see a total lunar eclipse(Opens in a new window) when the Full Moon becomes transformed into a mottled reddish ball for 78 minutes as it becomes completely immersed in the shadow of the Earth.

This total lunar eclipse will be the first one widely visible from North America in nearly 3.5 years. The Americas will have the best view of this eclipse, although over the Canadian Maritimes, moonset will intervene near the end of totality. Of special interest is the fact that the moon(Opens in a new window) will appear quite near to the bright star Spica, in the constellation Virgo, during the eclipse. They actually will be in conjunction a couple of hours prior to the onset of totality, but they're still relatively near to each other when the eclipse gets underway.

April 22: The Lyrid meteor shower

Rather favorable circumstances are expected for this year's Lyrid meteor shower(Opens in a new window), predicted to be at maximum this morning. The radiant, located near the brilliant bluish-white star Vega, rises in the northeast about the time evening twilight ends, and viewing will improve until light from the last-quarter moon begins to interfere just after 2 a.m. your local time.

Under the best conditions, 10 to 15 members of this shower can be seen in an hour by a single observer. The Lyrids remain about a quarter of their peak number for about two days. These bright meteors are associated with Thatcher's Comet of 1861.

April 28 and 29: A Ring Eclipse that nobody will see?

It is quite possible that only penguins will witness the annular solar eclipse, also known as a ""ring of fire"" solar eclipse(Opens in a new window). That's because it will occur within the uninhabited region of Wilkes Land in Antarctica.

Those living in southernmost parts of Indonesia as well as Australia (where it will be autumn) will at least get a view of a partial eclipse of the sun. Because the axis of the moon's antumbral shadow misses the Earth and only its edge grazes Antarctica, it makes an accurate prediction of the duration of annularity all but impossible.

May 6: The Eta Aquarid meteor shower

The annual Eta Aquarid meteor shower -- ""shooting stars"" spawned by the famed Halley's Comet(Opens in a new window) -- is scheduled to reach maximum early this morning. It's usually the year's richest meteor display for Southern Hemisphere observers, but north of the equator the Eta Aquarid shower is one of the more difficult annual displays to observe.

From mid-northern latitudes, the radiant (from where the meteors appear to emanate) rises about 1:30 a.m. local daylight time, scarcely two hours before morning twilight begins to interfere. At peak activity, about a dozen shower members can be seen per hour by a single observer with good sky conditions from latitude 26 degrees North, but practically zero north of latitude 40 degrees. The shower remains active at roughly one-half peak strength for a couple of days before and after the maximum. Conditions this year are excellent; the moon is absent from the predawn sky for more than a week around maximum.

Facts About the Eta Aquarid Meteor Shower(Opens in a new window)

May 10: Saturn at opposition

The ringed planet Saturn reaches opposition; it rises in the east-southeast at dusk, is due south in the middle of the night and sets in the west-southwest at dawn. Once it gains enough altitude, it appears similarly as bright as the zero-magnitude stars Arcturus and Vega.

Saturn's famous rings(Opens in a new window) appear much more impressive than in recent years, since they are now tipped by 21.5 degrees from edge on.

May 24: Possible outburst of bright meteors

Perhaps the most dramatic sky event in 2014 could come at the start of the Memorial Day weekend. In the predawn hours of Saturday, May 24, our planet is expected to sweep through a great number of dusty trails left behind in space by the small comet P/209 LINEAR(Opens in a new window).

This unusual cosmic interaction might possibly result in an amazing, albeit brief display of meteors -- popularly known as ""shooting stars"" -- perhaps numbering in the many dozens . . . or even hundreds per hour. Nobody knows exactly how many meteors will be seen, but several meteor scientists believe that because the particles will be unusually large, the meteors will be outstandingly bright.

May 25: Mercury attains its greatest elongation

The planet Mercury(Opens in a new window) will reach its greatest elongation, or greatest angular distance, east of the sun on this night. This is Mercury's best evening apparition of the year; it sets about 100 minutes after sunset. An hour after sunset, look low above the west-northwest horizon; the speedy planet should be easily visible as a yellowish ""star.""",4/1/2014 0:00,0.661538,4,2,0,4.516556,7,Business,0,3581.094,2550.602,3600,0.291771,0.039067,0.033113,0.039735,0.5,0.5,6800

6645973,Should We Kill Four Lions for the Sake of the Pride?,"A wave of fresh outrage spread across the globe in March after the Copenhagen Zoo -- now infamous for killing a healthy 18-month-old giraffe just over a month ago -- culled four lions to make room for a new male who they hope will start a new pride. But even more than outrage, the killings have spurred conversation about how best to control animal populations in zoos.

European zoos like the one in Copenhagen often favor euthanasia when a population gets out of control or becomes too genetically similar, which puts the animals at risk of inbreeding. Zoos in Europe don't have the range of options that American zoos have when it comes to moving animals to other locations that are more suitable. Many of them argue that euthanizing some animals is often better for the population as a whole because it allows grown animals to rear their offspring to a point. Copenhagen Zoo is against birth control because it prevents animals from acting as they would in the wild(Opens in a new window).

SEE ALSO: Copenhagen Zoo Kills 4 Lions Weeks After Giraffe Controversy

American zoos, by and large, favor contraception(Opens in a new window). Birth control may keep animals from breeding for a time, but they argue that it is better to prevent breeding than allow an animal to be born when the zoo knows it will soon have no room for the animal.

""In Copenhagen Zoo we let the animals breed naturally,"" the zoo said in a statement(Opens in a new window) posted on its website when officials killed Marius the giraffe. ""That means that the animals get to carry out their natural behaviors. Parental care is a big part of an animalâ€™s behavior.""

Later, zoo officials added, ""Contraceptives have a number of unwanted side effects on the internal organs, and we would therefore apply a poorer animal welfare if we did not euthanize.â€

This means Copenhagen Zoo prefers to let its animals live as natural a life as possible in captivity -- free of birth control. However, this allows for the birth of animals that the zoo may not have room for -- or that may put the population at risk of inbreeding -- and often results in euthanasia. The Copenhagen Zoo euthanizes around 30 animals per year.

The European Association of Zoos and Aquariums, the governing body for those establishments across Europe, defended the zoo's choice(Opens in a new window) to kill the lions in a statement(Opens in a new window) on its website:

The zoo has been consistent in its approach to animal-population management and high standards of animal welfare. Copenhagen Zoo takes an approach that good welfare in the pride is stimulated and enhanced by natural cycles of reproduction, and that cub-rearing is an essential part of pride activity. As a result, while EAZA regrets the death of the animals in question, we recognize the right of Copenhagen Zoo to humanely cull them in line with their policies.

The zoo, which declined to respond to our request for comment, was trying to make room for a new male lion(Opens in a new window) that would lead a younger pride and mate with two young lionesses. Two of the lions killed were older, and the zoo said those lions would have tried to kill the new male because they would perceive him as a threat to their established pride. The other two euthanized lions were cubs. According to zoo officials, the new male would have killed the cubs because male lions typically eliminate all sexually immature young that aren't their own offspring when they establish control of a new pride.

The reasoning is scientifically sound. The young lionesses are the offspring of one of the older lions, and keeping the older lion around would have risked inbreeding. The new male assures genetic diversity.

Zoo officials in the United States told Mashable they understand the scientific validity of how the Copenhagen Zoo operates, and that, logically, it is best to cull a few animals for the good of the larger number. But U.S. officials also said they feel that the Copenhagen Zoo is failing to grasp how the public reacts to euthanasia of healthy animals.

""We're zoos; we're in the public eye,"" said Rick Barongi, director of the Houston Zoo. ""If we say we care for animals and we have the highest standards of care, you can't euthanize them.""

Others have questioned the reasoning behind the Copenhagen Zoo's euthanasia policy. Heather Robertson, a senior veterinarian at the Nashville Zoo, said modern contraception doesn't necessarily decrease an animal's quality of life.

""You look at all these years we've spayed and neutered dogs or controlled populations in that way for more domestic animals, and I don't think there's a decrease in the quality of life,"" Robertson said. ""I understand what they're saying, because you're taking [away] that naturalistic drive that they would have. But with non-permanent controls, you can reverse that and put them back in a breeding state.""

The Association of Zoos and Aquariums, which oversees those American organizations, declined to respond to a set of questions, but it has been quick to point out that euthanasia is a last resort in the United States.

In a statement(Opens in a new window) on its website, it said: ""The Association of Zoos and Aquariums regrets the unfortunate incident at the Copenhagen Zoo involving the death of a giraffe. Incidents of that sort do not happen at AZA-accredited zoos and aquariums for several reasons.""

Those reasons are in part because AZA-accredited zoos ""carefully manage breeding programs,"" according to the site, and American zoos have a ""well-developed"" animal exchange program that ensures the animals will have a home elsewhere.

Still, Barongi and Robertson acknowledge that finding a home for animals is more difficult for European zoos because regulations there prevent the zoos from transferring animals to private owners or zoos that are suitable but not accredited by an overseeing organization.

""I don't think they have as many options over there. But, that said, they should be creating options and be proactive,"" said Barongi, adding that he respects the Copenhagen Zoo's conservation program.

Barongi hopes zoo officials address the euthanasia issue at the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums meetings that will take place this coming May and November.

For its part, the WAZA issued a somewhat contradictory statement(Opens in a new window) after Marius the giraffe was killed, saying it recognizes that euthanasia can be necessary to control populations, but that it should be used ""only as a last resort.""

""No zoo is happy to euthanize animals or doing this without serious considerations,"" Gerald Dick, WAZA's executive director, told Mashable in an email. ""If all options have been checked, euthanasia might remain as one last option to take.""",4/1/2014 0:00,0.529557,11,1,1,4.949657,4,00000,2000,3578.163,2587.934,1327,0.34625,0.048542,0.011442,0.009153,1,0,1300

That's the situation Aereo faces in an upcoming court case according to Barry Diller, the media mogul whose company IAC backs the streaming television startup.

[seealso slug=http://mashable.com/2012/08/02/aereo-new-plans/]

""If we lose, we're finished,"" Diller said in an interview(Opens in a new window) with Bloomberg TV.

The bluntness of Diller's stance highlights the stakes at play. A victory for Aereo would be the ultimate validation of the legality of the company's model as well as a major precedent for future cases involving rebroadcasting and cloud storage.

If Aereo loses, the company has little chance to survive even if it attempts to go the traditional route of paying broadcasters, Diller said.

""We could probably pay retransmission consent dollars if we could make a deal with broadcasters,"" he said. ""But the value proposition would go out of the game because Aereo is a low-cost method of receiving over the air broadcasting. That's the platform.""

Aereo has faced legal challenges since its early days. A group of broadcasters sued the steaming TV provided in March 2012 but lost almost every case except in a state court in Utah. After a loss in a U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, the Supreme Court said it would hear the case.

Aereo may face a tough road forward even if it goes win. CBS CEO Les Moonves recently said an Aereo victory in court would force his company to explore the development of its own streaming service. As of now, Aereo has few competitors.

The Internet-connected set-top box, which uses voice search when you speak into the remote and also serves as a gaming console, was announced during a launch event in New York City on Wednesday with Amazon VP Peter Larsen playing master of ceremonies, not CEO and founder Jeff Bezos.

The Amazon Fire TV, which is not a dongle like the Google Chromecast device, starts shipping today. To check out the product, click here(Opens in a new window).

The voice-activated device aims to take away the frustrations of scrolling and clicking for letters on an alphabet grid to find content. It also comes with a quad-core processor, 2 GB of RAM and a dedicated GPU for gaming purposes. Amazon said the Fire TV is three times more powerful than the Apple TV.

The remote control, which resembles a hybrid of the Apple TV remote and Boxee's original remote, is Bluetooth-based. The gaming controller costs an additional $39.

Fire TV is based on Android and HTML 5, which means it should be easy for companies to bring their apps over to the platform. Although it supports Hulu Plus, Netflix, Pandora, YouTube and Crackle, users will not be able to access HBO Go and Vudu. However, it will show you content available based on your subscriptions. Music can also be streamed via Pandora, iHeartRadio and Vevo.

Fire TV also serves as a predictive engine called ""ASAP,"" which pre-loads content it thinks you are going to watch, so it can start without any buffering or load time. This feature learns over time and gets better at suggesting content you like.

In a big move, Fire TV also serves as a gaming console and offers titles such as ""Minecraft"", ""The Walking Dead"" and ""Monsters University"" and many are free or as low as $1.85 to play. Users will be able to play Minecraft, which allows for co-op mode that will let users play with friends on their phones or tablets in the same environment.

â€œWe wanted to build a streaming media device that allowed customers to play a variety of games at affordable prices,"" a company spokesperson said during the event. ""By next month, thousands of games will be available for customers to play. Customers can use the Fire TV remote, and they can also use an app for phones or tablets as a controller. There is also a dedicated game controller available as an accessory.""

Amazon has been a leader in the e-reader and tablet space for awhile, so a move to TV set-top boxes is a natural step for the company as it builds off of its video offerings. Although many set-top boxes already have access to its Prime Instant Video streaming library, this allows Amazon to ramp up its device collection while providing content directly to users. Plus, it serves as new incentive for developers to create apps for Amazon's Kindle ecosystem.

Amazon said it wants to close in on three key areas it wants to fix: search, performance and closed ecosystem.

The first set-top box that supported Amazon videos -- previously called Amazon Unbox -- was the TiVo, back in 2006. Amazon video later came to Roku devices in 2008, and the company rolled out Prime Instant Video in 2011. Bezos hinted a hardware device was in the works in September in an interview with Mashable's Lance Ulanoff.

In a prior announcement made this weekend, Amazon said it will be turning six shows from its Amazon Originals program into a full series. The shows, which were selected after viewer feedback from the pilot episodes, include The After, Bosch, Gortimer Gibbonâ€™s Life on Normal Street, Mozart in the Jungle, Transparent and Wishenpoof! Amazon also renewed Alpha House -- starring John Goodman -- for a second season.

Amazon's Prime Instant Video also became the exclusive subscription streaming home for the popular show 24, pulling the series from Netflix after years on the site. The move comes just weeks before 24: Live Another Day returns to Fox for a limited-episode run, starting May 5. Netflix users who planned to catch up on the series before it comes back to Fox will have to turn to Prime Instant Video to get their fill.

7013509,Amazon Fire TV vs. Apple TV vs. Roku 3 vs. Chromecast,"The newly-announced Amazon Fire TV wants to take over your living room with its tiny, flat media box, but with lots of other existing devices on the market, you'll want to consider all streaming options first before making a purchase.

Fire TV -- a set-top box, gaming console hybrid -- will directly compete against streaming devices like Apple TV, Roku and Google Chromecast, but it will also take on gaming consoles such as Xbox One, PlayStation 4 and even the Android-powered Ouya.

For the sake of comparing Fire TV to existing set-top boxes -- and leaving the gaming consoles out for now -- there's a lot to be said about its bells and whistles. First, it uses voice search when you speak into the remote and boasts a stronger quad-core processor than the Roku 3 (double core), Apple TV (single core) and Chromecast (single core).

Fire TV also wins in terms of memory (2GB), compared to 512 MB included in the other three devices. Price is virtually the same across the board ($99), with the exception of the Google Chromecast at $35.

But you'll also want to factor in content compatibility into your purchase decision. Although Fire TV supports Hulu Plus, Netflix, Pandora and YouTube, users will not be able to access HBO Go, which is available for streaming on all three other devices. On the plus side, you can -- unsurprisingly -- access Amazon Instant Video via Fire TV (as well as the Roku 3), but users of Chromecast and Apple TV are out of luck.

And for those with their eyes on gaming, Fire TV and Roku 3 offer games, whereas Chromecast and Apple TV do not.

The controller will allow users to play games on the Kindle Fire-like device that Amazon announced Wednesday in New York. Rumored images of it were leaked last month from the Brazilian parallel of the FCC.

Amazon announced content will come from Ubisoft, 2K, Gameloft, EA, Sega, Double Fine and Minecraft creator Mojang. The controller will also come bundled with coins to purchase games.

One of the first games to launch with the Fire TV will be Sev Zero, a ""mix of tower defense and shooter"" created by Amazon's own Game Studios. The game is out Wednesday for $6.99, but will also be free to anyone who purchases a controller.

Mike Frazzini, Amazon's head of games, told Mashable that developers can work with the company to port games to the store, and make sure they'll work with the Amazon controller. The Fire TV can handle other controllers as well, Frazzini said, as well as input from other mobile devices, provided several options for local multiplayer.

Games will be downloaded to the set-top box, and not streamed. The box has 2 GB of local storage.

Itâ€™s hardware that supports Amazonâ€™s existing Prime video service, Netflix and a handful of other streaming options. It plays music and games. There really wasnâ€™t much we didnâ€™t know about the $99 box before Amazon VP Peter Larsen took the stage.

But by the time he was done, we had a whole set of new questions. I talked to Larsen at the launch event, and got a few answers for some of our most pressing questions.

Who makes the Amazon Fire TVâ€™s graphics chip?

According to Larsen, itâ€™s a Qualcomm Arduino 320 GPU. That graphics horsepower comes as part of Qualcommâ€™s Snapdragon S4 processor, which as Amazon explained during the unveiling, is a Quad Core CPU. Often found in mobile device, the S4 and its graphics GPU support 1080p video, 3D stereo photography, high-speed USB 2.0 and Bluetooth 4.0.

Is there a bundled deal for Amazon Fire TV and the Fire Game Controller?

Fire TV costs $99 and the game controller costs $39.99. Itâ€™s conceivable many people will want to buy them together. For now though, a deal is not in the cards. â€œWeâ€™re not announcing anything around that at this time,â€ said Larsen, â€œbut itâ€™s a good idea.â€

Do existing Amazon Prime customers get a deal on the new hardware?

No. Amazon Prime customers already pay $99 a year (it used to be $79) for free two-day shipping and access to Amazonâ€™s Prime Video content library. They do get the first month of Prime access free (which means initial sign-up is really a 13-month deal). Said Larsen: ""We think itâ€™s a pretty great product for the price already.â€

Why didnâ€™t Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos personally unveil Fire TV?

Bezos has a history of personally delivering the message on new product categories. He did it for the first Kindle, and again for the first Kindle Fire tablet. When Amazonâ€™s new line of HD tablets came out, Bezos personally sat down with journalists. This time, no Bezos. â€œWe like to mix it up,â€ Larsen said. â€œI know he loves [Fire TV], thatâ€™s for sure.â€

Is Amazon Fire TV intended to compete with game consoles like the Xbox One?

No. Even though this set-top box has ample graphics horsepower and an admirable amount of memory (2 GB of RAM), itâ€™s a casual gaming device. The box includes 8 GB of storage -- as little as an entry-level iPhone. A game like Call of Duty is roughly 2 GB and would eat up a quarter of the Fire TV's storage space.

But the Fire isn't geared towards that kind of gamer. â€œItâ€™s really apples and oranges,â€ explained Larsen. â€œThis isnâ€™t trying to compete against consoles â€“- at all.â€

Can you expand the storage space?

During the launch, Amazon demonstrated the graphics-rich mobile game Asphalt 8 running on Fire TV -- but even that eats up almost 1GB of storage. Is there a way to store more than 8GB worth of games? Apparently so.

â€œYou know, it has a USB port on it,â€ said Larsen. â€œSo we donâ€™t have anything specifically to announce there, but itâ€™s a pretty good idea. You could add a USB stick to it over time.â€

What is ASAP, how does it work and can you turn it off?

One of the more interesting features youâ€™ll find in Amazon Fire TV is ASAP, which is more than just a content recommendation engine. â€œBasically, ASAP predicts what youâ€™re most likely to watch,"" Larsen said. ""It cues those TV shows and movies up, so they start instantly.""

This is far beyond the â€œRecommendations for Youâ€ you might find in Netflix. The recommendations are figured out on Amazonâ€™s servers. â€œMost of our recommendations algorithms run up in the cloud, as you might expect, because weâ€™re applying it to a large catalog of content.â€ Can consumers turn this feature off? No, Larsen said: â€œIâ€™m not sure why they would want to.â€

[seealso slug=""amazon-fire-tv-competition""]

Why is there no Store on Fire TV?

The absence of an Amazon retail destination on Amazon Fire TV is a surprise. What better place to allow existing customers to do some couch-based shopping? Sure, they have their tablets (and Kindle Fires do include a shopping destination) -- but some might want retail therapy on the largest screen in their house.

â€œItâ€™s a good idea and weâ€™re not going to talk about our future roadmap at this time,"" said Larsen. ""But as you can expect, we agree with you that itâ€™s an area ripe for innovation.â€

Does Fire TV voice search work locally or access the Amazon cloud?

Amazonâ€™s Fire TV includes what may be the first set-top remote with voice control. Itâ€™s there primarily to help you find content. How does it work? Remotely: you speak, and voice search pings Amazonâ€™s servers for the answer.

Whereâ€™s Mayday?

Last year, Amazon introduced a 24-hour, 7-days-a-week live customer service platform on its HDX tablets. Amazon customers press the Mayday icon on their tablet, and almost immediately see live video of an Amazon customer service representative. Seems like a perfect fit for a $99 box that a lot of tech neophytes might buy, no?

Sadly, there's no MayDay on the Amazon Fire TV â€“ for now. â€œItâ€™s a nice idea,â€ said Larsen, who seemed to like all my ideas. â€œWeâ€™re gonna watch what customers think and what theyâ€™re saying and telling us. If they think itâ€™s an important feature, weâ€™ll figure out a way to innovate on that over time.""

Do you get more cloud storage when you buy Amazon Fire TV?

An Amazon account includes 5GB of free cloud storage. You can buy more on an as-needed basis. During the product unveiling, Larsen showed how he could take a photo on his smartphone, upload it to the Amazon cloud and have it appear on his Fire TV moments later. That kind of functionality might encourage more people to use Amazonâ€™s cloud storage.

Unfortunately, you wonâ€™t get any extra, free cloud space with your new Fire TV.

Is the Amazon Fire TV hardware being sold at cost?

When I met with Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos last year, he outlined the companyâ€™s device strategy: â€œwe want to make money when people use our devices, not when they buy devices.â€

What that means: Amazon typically prices hardware so it can cover the costs of making it. This helps make the hardware appealing for consumers, and allows Amazon to make more money when customers buy Amazonâ€™s goods and services through these devices.

With Amazon Fire TV, ""we are following that same strategy,â€ said Larsen. â€œThereâ€™s actually an unbelievable amount of technology in this product for $100.â€

Does adding yet another Amazon Device impact content access elsewhere?

No: you can have as many Amazon devices as you want on a single account. The only limit is how many devices can share a single piece of content. Amazon does not set those rules; the content publishers do. Larsen told me Amazon has no plans to change how it manages memberships and accounts.

How long was Amazon TV in development?

A couple of years.

7033367,Why Amazon Is Releasing a Set-Top Box,"Apple TV's pointer makes it frustrating to use. Roku's search needs work. Chromecast has ""poor performance.""

That was the message Amazon delivered at a press event on Tuesday before it announced plans to release a set-top box of its own called Fire TV. The device has dual-band WiFi, 2GB of RAM and voice search, among other features. It can serve as a gaming console. And it goes on sale Tuesday for $99.

The new product, which was originally rumored to be scheduled for last year, may give Amazon more footing in customers' living rooms and pit the company against the likes of Apple, Google and Roku. As with pretty much everything Amazon does, though, it's not really about the hardware -- it's about what you can buy through the hardware.

""The device is the Trojan horse,"" says Jim Nail, an analyst with Forrester Research. ""The content is the gate they're going through and what they are really going after is however many trillion dollars [of] retail spending there is out there.""

U.S. consumers still spend far more time watching television through traditional means rather than online, according to Nail. If Amazon can become more of a gatekeeper in the television experience, Nail says, ""they will find a way to derive revenue from every single thing that people watch.""

It will likely be a powerful selling point for entertainment content and Amazon services like Prime, a premium service that offers streaming videos, but that could be just the tip of the iceberg. Tony Wible, an analyst with Janney Capital Markets, expects Amazon to use interactive ads to direct viewers to products sold on the ecommerce giant's website.

""You would fast forward and see ads just as you do today, with the exception that those ads may be interactive. You buy it and it shows up on your door two days later,"" Wible says. ""[Amazon] will not be able to do that on an Xbox. You want to have your own end-to-end ecosystem.""

At the same time, the service may help Amazon boost revenue from video ads. Amazon's global ad revenue jumped 35% in 2013 to $718.3 million, according to data from eMarketer. Assuming Fire TV serves as a platform for a video advertising stream, Nail says it ""would give a huge boost to Amazon's online ad business.""

Amazon stock was up by about 0.5% following the announcement.

The online retailer is hosting a product launch event in New York City on Wednesday, starting at 11 a.m. ET, which promises to deliver an update on its ""video business.""

The invite, which arrived late last week, is short on precious details, though it does include an image of a living room couch with a bowl of popcorn nearby. The message is clear: Amazon is going to talk about home video, but in what form?

Speculation has it that Amazon will finally unveil its own set-top box, something akin to Apple TV or Roku. It may even be a tiny dongle like Google's Chromecast. While the inclusion of the Amazon Prime video streaming service -- currently part of the $99/year Amazon Prime package -- is obvious, the hardware may include some additional features that set it apart from other set-top players.

Recently leaked photos purport to show an Amazon game controller. The thinking is that it would be a companion to the Amazon dongle, which would include gaming capabilities.

Something else to consider: Amazon's hardware will, like the Kindle and Kindle HD tablets, be a portal to its expansive online retail offerings. If you buy one of these new Amazon dongles, you'll be shopping for virtually everything through your TV.

While the concept of shopping via one of these boxes is nothing new -- buy TV shows and movies through Apple TV -- buying items for the rest of your home and life is like the Home Shopping Network without all talking heads and needless calling.

Amazon VP Peter Larsen is running the show today, not CEO and founder Jeff Bezos, so there's a small chance Amazon won't introduce new hardware and will instead unveil a subtle yet important change to the Amazon Prime streaming service. However, this seems highly unlikely.

7033259,"More Women Game Developers Means More Success, 'Animal Crossing' Director Says","Who are video games for, exactly?

It's a question that games and developers have wrestled with through the decades. While glitzy marketing campaigns for first-person shooters like Call of Duty amplify the message that gaming is dominated by males out for blood, a different narrative is being painted by Nintendo.

SEE ALSO: Nintendo Mulling Mobile Apps as Part of Recovery Plan

Last year, the Japanese game maker sold millions of copies of its city-building franchise Animal Crossing: New Leaf. It helped raise Nintendo's stock this summer after a rocky launch in 2011.

One of its directors, Aya Kyogoku, called the series part of its own genre: inclusionary games.

""When I think of inclusionary games, I think of ones that all genders and ages and peoples can play and join. That was certainly my approach with creating the development space and filling it with all different kinds of ideas and experiences through the staff,"" Kyogoku told Mashable in an interview at this year's Game Developers Conference.

Kyogoku said the development team on New Leaf was a 50/50 gender split, something American game studios might be surprised or envious to see. (Plenty of talks at 2014's GDC focused on getting more women to join the games industry.(Opens in a new window)) Kyoguku said she worked on male-dominated teams in the past -- her long history with Nintendo includes working on The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess and Animal Crossing: City Folk for the Wii -- but she has seen more women join her teams in the past few years.

""And having worked in that environment with a more gender-balanced team, I can certainly say that I've seen an effect in our daily communications in the development process because you do get a greater variety of ideas and opinions and those all come from personal experiences,"" she said.

It wasn't enough to bring in a lot of voices, though; Kyogoku stressed part of her job as director was to make sure everyone's opinions were part of the conversation.

""There are people who will openly share their opinions and they are very used to that. There are others that may not feel like they can express themselves until maybe you ask them. I will actually go out of my way and approach those people who maybe don't feel like they can openly share their opinions and really try to draw it out of them. It's one thing I take it upon myself to do,"" she said.

While Kyogoku was quick to point out this wasn't a new idea to development, its importance was was significant in a game like Animal Crossing, which gives players granular control over everything about their character, house and town. Small, cute details like hairstyles or outfits may be easy to flip aside, but because the players care about them, the team cares about them.

""There might be some hairstyles that men think are cute, and some that women think are cute, even though the character may be a female,"" said Kyogoku, gesturing to an Animal Crossing character on the screen. ""One person might think a particular hairstyle is cute, but when you get a room of different experiences and different perspectives, you can really flesh those out, and say OK, the majority of people think this is cute, regardless of gender.

""If one person is responsible for defining what is cute and what is appealing then you'll get less diversity in the end, and less representation of what is actually true.""",4/2/2014 0:00,0.381727,5,4,0,4.325882,9,00000,0,3578.163,1798.76,1200,0.342802,0.058409,0.037647,0.023529,0.566667,-0.01667,946

The sea ice cover surrounding the North Pole, which expands and thickens during the northern winter and shrinks and gets thinner during the spring and summer, was only able to grow to the fifth-lowest peak extent on record since satellite data began in 1978, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center(Opens in a new window) in Boulder, Colo. Sea ice extent is a way of measuring the area covered by sea ice, as estimated using satellite imagery.

SEE ALSO: The Navy Lays Out Its Plan for a More Accessible Arctic

Arctic sea ice extent has plummeted in recent years due in large part to manmade global warming, setting a record low in 2012. The relatively low sea-ice maximum comes after a winter in which much of the coldest Arctic air in the Canadian and American portions of the Arctic was redirected southward into eastern Canada and the U.S., with large portions of the Arctic having a milder than average winter.

In a statement on its website, the NSIDC said Arctic sea ice reached its maximum extent for the year on March 21 at 5.76 million square miles. This came after sea ice extent had fallen close to a record low(Opens in a new window) during the middle of February. Sea ice extent climbed sharply in mid-March, preventing a record or near-record low at the end of the winter season.

Imagery from the European Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) show the distribution of multi-year ice compared to first-year ice for March 28, 2013 (yellow line) and March 2, 2014 (blue line). Credit:

Arctic sea ice was near average across most of the Arctic Ocean this winter, except in the Barents Sea off of Alaska and the Sea of Okhotsk, near far eastern Russia, where levels were below average.

The NSIDC said average sea ice extent in March averaged 282,000 square miles below the 1981-2010 average, and 127,000 square miles above the record March monthly low, which occurred in 2006. Through 2014, March sea ice extent has declined at a rate of 2.6% per decade, compared to the 1981-2010 average.

Arctic sea ice has been in a steep decline for the past two decades as manmade global warming has taken its toll. The pace of ice decline has been especially steep in recent years, which has had ramifications throughout the Arctic, and may be altering weather patterns across North America and Europe. Sea-ice loss has added heat to the Arctic Ocean, speeding up melting of more sea ice, as well as land-based ice sheets in Greenland.

The added heat in the upper layers of the Arctic Ocean has been enough to melt 3.2 to 4.2 feet of sea ice during the summer, according to a recent study(Opens in a new window). The same study found the Arctic-wide melt season has grown longer, at a rate of five days per decade, since 1979. The main factor has been a later fall freeze date. The study also found that the timing of the peak ice extent can influence how much ice melts during the melt season; this year's peak was the fifth-latest on record.

One sign that may indicate the 2014 melt season won't hit a new record-low ice extent -- although this is far from a reliable indicator -- is the presence of older, thicker ice in the Arctic basin compared to 2013. This winter, the multi-year ice makes up 43% of the icepack compared to only 30% in 2013, the NSIDC said.

""While this is a large increase, and may portend a more extensive September ice cover this year compared to last year, the fraction of the Arctic Ocean consisting of multi-year ice remains less than that at the beginning of the 2007 melt season (46%) when a large amount of the multi-year ice melted,"" the NSIDC said. ""The percentage of the Arctic Ocean consisting of ice at least five years or older remains at only 7%, half of what it was in February 2007.""

7006737,When Will AR Replace the Fitting Room?,"We've been told the way we shop at our favorite stores is on the cusp of major and innovative change for years. Now we're seeing retailers incorporate interactive technology to give the traditional shopping experience a digital makeover.

Activations from digital signage to iPads to interactive displays to augmented reality encourage shoppers to browse broader collections and try inventories on -- without having to visit the dressing room.

â€œThe conversation with retail partners for the past few years was about how they can encourage customers to share out their experiences in store, be it a photo of an outfit they tried on, or a great service experience,â€ said Sam Ewen, CEO of The SuperTouch Group(Opens in a new window), an experiential marketing technology company helping retailers create unique in-store experiences.

Those concepts we heard about years back are finally becoming reality.

Augmented reality is expensive, but it's coming

We started hearing about augmented reality and virtual dressing rooms as early as 2005, Ewen says. â€œItâ€™s only now that technology, specifically Kinect, is getting closer to catching up and concept videos you may have seen are becoming more realistic. But we're still not there yet.â€

But technology needs a bit more time to match consumer expectations.

â€œVirtual reality and augmented reality shopping still isnâ€™t to a point where you experience the same sensuality of trying on clothes and seeing how they complement the contours of your body,â€ says Jeremy Bergstein(Opens in a new window) of The Science Project(Opens in a new window).

â€œShoppers donâ€™t want their dressing room experiences â€˜disruptedâ€™ by technology. They want their time to be enhanced.â€

Despite the explosive growth of online shopping, as epitomized by Warby Parker, buying clothes is still wedded to in-person shopping, a reflection of the consumerâ€™s hesitation to digitize such an incredibly personal process. According to a 2013 study(Opens in a new window) by Alert Technologies(Opens in a new window), brick-and-mortar retailers that get shoppers into their dressing rooms will convert 67% of them to buyers.

Matt Szymczyk(Opens in a new window) and his team at Zugara(Opens in a new window) are working to increase sales conversions by making enhancements with their virtual dressing room, but still require consumers engage with in-store textile. In its pilot, the Virtual Style Sense (VSS) technology increases inventory and choice for consumers, without taking up additional retail space.

Zugara announced last week at Londonâ€™s Retail Business and Technology Expo(Opens in a new window) that VSS allows consumers wearing a retail garment to cycle through additional colors and styles available in the retailerâ€™s portfolio, without having to change clothes.

[seealso slug=""ikea-augmented-reality""]

â€œThe problem with the virtual dressing room and in-store augmented reality experiences is asset creation,â€ Szymczyk says. â€œEvery piece of inventory would have to be textured and 3D-rendered and then engineered to interact and fit on vastly different body types in a real-time experience. That would assume $2,000 to $3,000 per inventory item, and once you start thinking about that as a cost each season, youâ€™re talking big numbers for retailers right now. VSS provides a unique in-between phase for brick-and-mortar businesses.â€

Szymczyk says his team has received a huge response from retailers, and has plans for activations in the U.S. in the next few weeks. â€œTake a T-shirt as an example. You can now try on just one shirt and see how you look in the striped version or green or hot pink without having to change.â€

Linda Smith(Opens in a new window), CEO and founder of FaceCake(Opens in a new window), spoke with Mashable previously about the Clueless Closet becoming a reality. She says while virtual dressing rooms still have technology limitations, there are undeniable opportunities for retailers.

The bigger win is social media integration

FaceCake allows customers to try on accessories, eyewear and even makeup through AR and an interactive mirrored screen, while a gesture-enabled user interface allows for intuitive sorting through retailer inventory. â€œWhatâ€™s really a huge opportunity for virtual dressing rooms is really the ability to capture and share in real-time with your friends,â€ Smith said.

FaceCakeâ€™s technology also allows consumers to compare two different looks side-by-side, but now you can both see and share two entirely different looks side-by-side in real-time and share those two looks with friends. â€œWhen given a choice between two necklaces or two dresses, thereâ€™s always a standout choice,â€ Smith says. â€œWhat Kinect and AR can do for us right now is allow retailers to showcase more inventory, and allow consumers to make more educated choices.â€

7033105,It's Good to Be on YouTube: AwesomenessTV Acquires Big Frame,"You know itâ€™s a good time to be a multichannel YouTube network when youâ€™re acquired for millions by another multichannel YouTube network -- which, incidentally, was itself recently acquired for even more millions.

Big Frame was picked up Wednesday for $15 million by Awesomeness TV, which last year was bought by DreamWorks Animation for $33 million (and considerably more, if it hits certain incentive targets).

Itâ€™s hardly the first MCN deal to resemble a Russian nesting doll: Last week, Disney dropped what could eventually amount to nearly $1 billion on YouTube multichannel leader Maker Studios, which last year picked up online-video distributor Blip.

Itâ€™s as if the exploding sector is modeling itself after the herky-jerky, quick-edit, what-exactly-is-the-point videos itâ€™s been peddling. Attention spans need not apply.

Big Frame and AwesomenessTV will each represent about half of the combined companyâ€™s now 80 million subscribers -- enough for nearly 1 billion monthly views â€“ once the deal goes through next month.

If you go back to 2011, when YouTube first launched its Original Channels Initiative, Big Frame was there, kicked off with a little more than $3 million. That investment has now been realized more than five times over in less than three years.

Still not sure whether itâ€™s a good time to be a multichannel YouTube network?

AwesomenessTV stands to trigger another $80 million or more from its acquisition deal with DreamWorks Animation, provided it can hit certain traffic and revenue marks. No doubt its pickup of Big Frame, with its talent, expertise and stable of established YouTube stars, will help it do just that.

And donâ€™t forget where all that traffic is coming from: Young, mostly inexperienced content creators who tirelessly churn out content that carries almost no overhead. Relative to a traditional TV pilot, their channels cost virtually nothing to launch â€“- often at free-to-use facilities such as Maker Studios in Culver City, Calif. and YouTube Space Los Angeles (with other locations popping up in New York and London) â€“- and are compensated almost exclusively through revenue-sharing backend deals that, on a case-by-case basis, carry no real financial risk.

That risk belongs to the big, traditional media companies that are driving this gold rush. Theyâ€™re the ones whoâ€™ll be holding the bag if the tricky monetization game â€“- and when youâ€™re dealing with YouTube's ad-revenue splits, thatâ€™s some dark alchemy indeed -â€“ turns out to be fool's gold.

Since August of last year, at least 10 Venezuelan dailies have gone out of print, while at least 11 have had to reduce their size, according to human rights organization Espacio Publico(Opens in a new window). Venezuelan newspapers are having a hard time importing newsprint, which isn't produced locally, because of government-imposed restrictions on obtaining U.S. dollars.

7013416,"Hands On With Cortana, Windows Phone's New Digital Assistant","Microsoft introduced Cortana, the company's long-rumored answer to Siri, at its Build Developer Conference in San Francisco Wednesday.

The service, which Microsoft is billing as the first ""true"" personal digital assistant, is similar to Siri and Google Now, but emphasizes developing a relationship.

[seealso slug= ""universal-windows-apps/""]

""Powered by Bing, Cortana is the only digital assistant that gets to know you, builds a relationship that you can trust, and gets better over time by asking questions based on your behavior and checking in with you before she assumes youâ€™re interested in something,"" said Belifore in a blog post(Opens in a new window). ""She detects and monitors the stuff you care about, looks out for you throughout the day, and helps filter out the noise so you can focus on what matters to you.""

While we didn't have time to develop a relationship with Cortana in the time we spent with her this afternoon, we got to know her a little bit when we went hands-on with a Nokia phone running Windows Phone 8.1 at Build. Here's what we found:

Reminders

Like Siri and Google Now, Cortana is really good at setting reminders. But Cortana appeared to be a little better at discerning natural language then Siri. And she has more options when making them: Reminders can be tied to a time, a place or even a specific person.

Credit: Mashable, Karissa Bell

For example, you can say ""Cortana, next time I talk to Glen, remind me to ask him about his new house,"" and the next time you communicate with Glen -- whether that's via a phone call, text, email, Skype or whatever -- the reminder appears onscreen. Or, you can ask Cortana to remind you to buy eggs when you get to the grocery store.

Cortana's Notebook

In keeping with the personal assistant theme, Cortana comes with a ""Cortana's Notebook"" feature that contains all of the personalized information Cortana curates about you, and the services that fall in her purview. Notebook sections include interests, remind me, quiet hours, inner circle, places and music searches.

Interests keeps tabs on info relevant to your day-to-day life like traffic conditions for your commute home, local weather forecasts and stocks you track. Inner circle keeps track of the contacts most important to you and those contacts will still be able to reach you during specified ""quiet hours,"" which is similar to Apple's ""Do Not Disturb"" feature.

Tracked interests are also reflected in Bing searches with relevant interests-- stocks you follow, for example-- highlighted when you're signed into Bing.

Chit-Chat

Dictating text messages worked well -- Cortana seemed to have no problem picking out our words, even in a crowded room with a lot of ambient noise. Cortana did seem to have some trouble identifying punctuation marks though-- an issue that also cropped up during the keynote when Microsoft's David Treadwell demoed Cortana's Twitter integration onstage and Cortana wrote out ""hashtag"" in place of the symbol.

When it came to general questions, Cortana was less consistent. Sports questions, for example, were hit or miss. While she was able to tell us when the next Edmonton Oilers game was, Cortana was not able to answer when the Stanley Cup would be played. Some of those issues will likely be ironed out though after the beta period ends later this year.

We asked Cortana what she thought of Siri. Credit: Mashable, Karissa Bell

Cortana's sense of humor did come through throughout our demo. Asking about Siri yielded a slightly snarky response and a question about Bill Gates was answered similarly (Cortana ""literally"" cannot imagine life without Bill Gates.)

Microsoft said the beta version Cortana will roll out to U.S. users in the coming weeks and will expand to the U.K. and China in the second half of 2014.",4/2/2014 0:00,0.680473,15,13,0,5.076923,7,Lifestyle,0,8537.597,3613.301,64100,0.5,0.095313,0.027473,0.010989,0.416667,0.083333,1900

DFM is made up of more than 100 newspapers across the United States from local titles to the Denver Post and claims a reach of 67 million people. The company's CEO, John Paton, is known for his outspoken views on the death of the newspaper industry and the need to pivot toward digital media. Thunderdome represented the company's big ambitions and willingness to invest in an effort to develop a modern media structure that could sustain local reporting.

[seealso slug=http://mashable.com/2014/03/26/online-journalism-pew/]

The move was confirmed by sources within DFM that asked not to be named. While the move had not been officially announced as of Wednesday morning, DFM editor in chief Jim Brady tweeted out a link to a Nieman Journalism Lab(Opens in a new window) story about the end of Thunderdome as well as an ominous message.

Seriously, if anyone out there is looking for talented digital folks across the skills spectrum, please let me know. [email protected] â€” Jim Brady (@jimbradysp) April 2, 2014 (Opens in a new window)

While the layoffs will only touch a small fraction of the company's more than 10,000 employees, cost savings to DFM will help any future efforts to attract buyers for its assets.

Thunderdome's closure comes just more than two months after AOL essentially abandoned its local news efforts in Patch. AOL sold a majority of Patch to a private equity company. Two weeks later, the company was rocked by layoffs.

DFM is also far from the only newspaper group to announce recent layoffs. Gannett announced a round of cuts(Opens in a new window) in August, with the Tribune Company(Opens in a new window) following suit in November. Headcount at newspaper has been steadily dropping.

""Full-time professional newsroom employment declined another 6.4% in 2012 with more losses expected for 2013,"" the Pew Research Center wrote in its 2014 State of the News Media report.

The cuts at DFM come just more than two months after the company announced Project Unbolt(Opens in a new window), which was designed to change the workflows at the company's papers to generate digital content that could then be assembled into print editions. In December, DFM merged MediaNews Group and 21st Century Media, two of the newspaper companies it managed.

Thunderdome was created to offer national and international content to its local media outlets to allow for its journalists to pursue local stories. Paton told the Denver Post in 2012(Opens in a new window) that the platform would minimize the number of journalists writing the same stories, saving resources and givings its people a chance to work on local content.

""Thunderdome is our attempt to increase the quality of the non-local content across all of our sites and across all of our platforms,"" Paton told the Denver Post(Opens in a new window) in 2012.

A recent presentation by Paton(Opens in a new window) posted to his blog highlighted the difficult situation for DFM. Despite growing revenue, costs had mounted and profits fallen.

""Why? Because print is dying much faster than anyone anticipated,"" Paton noted. ""And because the profound changes in digital revenue streams will require huge investments in digital products and people.""

Paton has also noted in the presentation that the company would need to double down on its investment in digital media.

7033087,"Despite Climate Warnings, Exxon Plans to Burn Through Oil and Gas Reserves","On the same day that the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released its new report warning that global warming will raise the risks of a host of potentially costly and deadly consequences, from sea level rise to food supply disruptions, Exxon Mobil Corp. released its own set of climate reports(Opens in a new window).

As one might expect from the worldâ€™s most profitable corporation and one of the largest oil companies, Exxonâ€™s documents, published Monday, struck a different tone from the IPCC.

Exxonâ€™s reports to its shareholders amount to an unprecedented disclosure of how the company views its risk exposure to climate change, specifically to potential greenhouse gas emissions reduction mandates that would curb oil and gas use between now and the year 2040. The company told its shareholders -- some of whom spent years trying to get the company to disclose its climate-related risks -- that it does not need to plan for aggressive carbon emissions cuts before 2040, because governments are unlikely to impose such expensive regulations.

Exxon cited a report by the International Energy Agency, which found that it would cost up to $45 trillion(Opens in a new window) to cut global greenhouse gas emissions to 50% below 2005 levels by 2050.

This finding is striking because, as the IPCC said, just such aggressive emissions cuts are required in order for the world to limit manmade global warming below dangerous levels.

In fact, while it acknowledged that its operations face some risks related to climate change policies, and that the company favors governmental action to reduce the severity of climate change, Exxon said its plans call for all of its oil and gas reserves to be exploited for generating electricity and powering transportation, among other uses, through 2040. Therefore, the company said, none of its oil and gas reserves are at risk of becoming â€œstranded assets.â€

Instead, these stores will be processed and ultimately burned, releasing more planet-warming gases such as carbon dioxide and methane.

â€œThe risk of climate change is clear and the risk warrants action,â€ said William Colton, Exxon's vice president of corporate strategic planning, in a press release.

However, Exxon said it is prioritizing the need to meet the worldâ€™s growing energy demands through its oil and gas products, rather than addressing climate change, during the next several decades.

â€œAll of ExxonMobil's current hydrocarbon reserves will be needed, along with substantial future industry investments, to address global energy needs,â€ Colton said.

If all of Exxonâ€™s oil and gas reserves were to be exploited, that would release at least 7.01 gigatons of carbon dioxide, the main long-lived greenhouse gas, based on 2013 data the group Fossil Free Indexes(Opens in a new window) provided to Mashable.

By comparison, all the fossil fuels burned in the U.S. in 2013 released about 5.4 gigatons of carbon dioxide, according to the Energy Information Agency(Opens in a new window). And other estimates of the carbon dioxide emissions that would result from burning Exxonâ€™s massive reserves are significantly higher, including a figure of 40 gigatons calculated by the environmental group 350.org.

â€œExxon basically says, â€˜we hear you about this climate change thing, weâ€™re just not going to do anything about it,â€™â€ said Brett Fleishman, a 350.org senior analyst, in an email to Mashable. â€œMaybe thatâ€™s because, for the last decade, Exxon has remained at the top of the owners list of potential carbon dioxide held by fully public companies.â€

In the reports and the press release, Exxon touted its investments in climate research, efficiency improvements within the company, and the companyâ€™s participation in â€œconstructive dialogue on policy options.â€

Figure that illustrates projected climate futures under a low emissions (RCP 2.6) and high emissions (RCP 8.5) scenario, along with observed changes in climate change risks. Credit: U.N. IPCC Working Group II

Until 2012, the company was one of the largest funders of organizations(Opens in a new window) that deny the existence and severity of manmade global warming, such as the Chicago-based Heartland Institute, which is a free-market think tank.

No need to plan for a low carbon scenario

In its climate reports, Exxon ruled out the possibility that its leaders would seek to meet the IPCCâ€™s low-carbon development scenario, which would limit global warming to 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit above preindustrial levels. The global community, including the United States, agreed to that temperature target(Opens in a new window) at a 2009 climate summit in Copenhagen, but since then emissions have continued to track far above the path that would be needed to meet that target.

Exxon says trying to meet the 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit target would be too costly, and it does not foresee a government-mandated commitment to do so. Instead, it foresees emissions growing along a mid-range scenario, which would yield warming of between about 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit and 6.3 degrees Fahrenheit compared to preindustrial levels by 2100.

Furthermore, the company said its oil and gas reserves are too important for lifting millions of people worldwide out of poverty, particularly in the developing world.

â€œ... We are confident that none of our hydrocarbon reserves are now or will become â€˜stranded,â€™ the companyâ€™s report said. â€œWe believe producing these assets is essential to meeting growing energy demand worldwide, and in preventing consumers -- especially those in the least developed and most vulnerable economies -- from themselves becoming stranded in the global pursuit of higher living standards and greater economic opportunity.â€

According to Exxonâ€™s scenario for global development through 2040, the world will require about 35% more energy in 2040 compared to 2010, the majority of which would still come from fossil fuels like oil and natural gas.

â€œIncreasing energy costs leads to a scarcity of affordable, reliable and accessible energy and can additionally lead to social instability,â€ the report said.

In its new report(Opens in a new window), the IPCC warned that climate change itself will raise the risk of social instability and could help drive conflicts in already unstable parts of the world, such as the Middle East.

Andrew Logan, who directs the oil and gas program at Ceres, a group that advocates changing market practices to incorporate long-term risks like climate change, said the reports are a positive step for Exxon but discouraging at the same time. â€œUltimately itâ€™s not up to Exxon how the world deals with climate change,â€ he told Mashable. â€œWe strongly disagree with some of the companyâ€™s sense of the likelihood of global action.â€ In other words, in Logan's view, world leaders are likely to act more aggressively to curb climate change than Exxon anticipates.

Logan said itâ€™s notable that the IPCC said on Monday that climate change jeopardizes economic growth, yet Exxon took the opposite view by saying that addressing climate change too aggressively would do the same thing.",4/2/2014 0:00,0.576433,7,0,0,4.913433,9,00000,0,3579.558,1830.858,4266.667,0.438675,0.036325,0.029851,0.01791,0.333333,0.25,826
7033140,Federal Agencies Still Require Software to Work With 12-Year-Old Windows XP,"During the past year, various agencies have bought or expressed interest in buying products compliant with a Microsoft operating system set to lose security support next week, according to a review of federal solicitations and the agencies themselves. The Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps, as well as the Veterans Affairs, Labor and State departments are a few of the Windows XP holdouts.

Microsoft will stop updating the 12-year-old operating system on April 8. With the company's software developers out of the picture, hackers who find holes can drop ""0-day exploits,"" or malicious software that penetrates systems running XP before anyone has time to fix them.

But some agencies need Windows XP to run mission-critical applications that are incompatible with newer operating systems. Others, fearing they might miss the cutoff date for security support, want products that will function on existing systems.

Here's a sample of the roughly 195 solicitations posted within the past year specifying Windows XP compliance:

The Air Mobility Command in May 2013 bought(Opens in a new window) a $6,875 touch screen computer that was required to support ""Windows XP Professional SP3 32 bit.""

The Naval Research Laboratory announced in April 2013 that it intended(Opens in a new window) to award a contract for a computer, with various accessories and ""Windows XP Installation.""

In April 2013, the I Marine Expeditionary Force at Camp Pendleton, Calif., solicited(Opens in a new window) software to model sound propagation that was ""compatible with a Windows XP OS.""

Last month, Veterans Affairs posted(Opens in a new window) an ad seeking an XP-compatible system to enable online registration for the National Veterans Golden Age Games, an event for older vets currently under care of the VA medical system.

Two special notebooks at a Labor agency needed Windows XP to run software that supports a critical-mission function.

State announced roughly 175 solicitations and awards for XP-compatible information technology tools and services.

A legacy issue

Roughly 3% of the Pentagon's several million unclassified and classified Windows machines are still running XP software, according to military officials.

Machines remaining on XP tend to require special engineering and testing ""to make sure that function and dependability are still correct after an operating system change,"" Richard Hale, deputy chief information officer for cybersecurity at the Department of Defense, said during an interview. ""Those tend to also be systems that get deployed often in places that have high operations tempo like ships. So it then takes us a while to deploy those.""

Defense has been upgrading, primarily to other Windows versions, at a rate of up to 60,000 computers a month.

""It will probably take us several years to get the last Windows XP"" machines transitioned, Hale said of approximately 1% of the department's Windows machines. ""There may be some special cases that take longer.""

The Pentagon is negotiating prices with Microsoft for extended Windows XP support, which will be lower than the commercial rate of $300 per PC per year, he said.

Hale could not speak to the specific solicitations the services have issued but said he believes they pertain to systems stuck in the changeover. ""As recently as a year ago, we had hundreds of thousands of Windows XP machines, and so people have had to support them as they transitioned their networks to Windows 7 or Windows 8,"" he said. ""They've had to support them and they will need to support them until they are completely out of the inventory.""

All military devices, whether on XP or upgraded software, are protected by layers of security systems, Hale said.

For instance, ""we have perimeter defenses that look for malware and can block it,"" as well as DOD-wide email scanning and intrusion detection systems, he said.

Cyber command to the rescue

Military cyber personnel will be paying attention to XP-enabled threats. ""Cyber Command is the top operator for the department and top defender for all of this stuff,"" Hale said. Every information security employee takes orders from the command.

While the military is not adding extra levels of defense as a direct consequence of Microsoft's decision to terminate support for the old operating system, ""our operations force will be attuned to Windows XP attacks just in case those go up after April 8,"" he said.

Not all federal contracting documents mentioning XP required technology dependent on that platform alone, indicating the purchasing agency could be planning to soon switch platforms. For example, in May 2013, Veterans Affairs asked for(Opens in a new window) a mobile device security tool that ""must be compatible with [i]OS, Android, Windows Mobile, Blackberry, Windows XP, Windows 7, and Windows 8.""

VA needs a Windows XP system for the Golden Age Games because agencies are at different stages of the conversion, according to a March 18 solicitation. ""Migration from Windows XP to Windows 7 is not yet complete within all of VA,"" the request for proposals states. ""As a result, compatibility with and support on Windows XP, Internet Explorer 7 and Microsoft Office 2007 are also required until April 2014 when Microsoft's extended support for Windows XP ends.""

Veterans Affairs officials said that more than 99% of the department's IT inventory -- about 390,000 Windows computers -- is now on Windows 7.

Highlights: 3 things you need to know now

A soldier opened fire at the Fort Hood Army complex in Texas on Wednesday.

Three members of the military were killed in the shooting, and 16 were injured. The shooter died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

Military officials say the shooter, who served in Iraq in 2011, was under treatment for mental and behavioral problems.

A gunman opened fire on Wednesday at Fort Hood military base in Killeen, Texas -- the same site of a November 2009 mass murder that claimed 13 lives.

Three people were killed in the shooting and 16 were injured. The shooter died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

Speaking to reporters late Wednesday evening, Fort Hood's Lt. Gen Mark Milley said there was no known motive in the shooting. He said the shooter, a soldier who served four months in Iraq in 2011, had mental health and behavioral health issues and was being treated for them. He had not been diagnosed for PTSD. The shooter, who is married and has a family, has not been identified pending next-of-kin notification. He used a .45 Smith & Wesson that he purchased in the local area, Lt. Gen Milley said.

The attack was stopped by a female MP, who was ""clearly heroicâ€¦.exactly what we would expect from a United State military police,"" he said.

President Obama, speaking in front of a black backdrop at a Chicago steakhouse, said, ""We are going to get to the bottom of exactly what happened. Any shooting is troubling. Obviously this reopens the pain of what happened at Fort Hood five years ago.""

""We're heartbroken something like this might have happened again,"" the president said.

Scott and White Memorial Hospital Chief Medical Officer Dr. Glenn Couchman said on Wednesday evening he was ""notified by officials at Fort Hood that there had been a shooting incident over there"" at about 5:05 p.m. local time. ""We have four patients that are actually here now, and two more en route."" Their injuries, he said, included wounds to the chest, abdomen, extremities, and neck, the official said.

Waco police had confirmed to Mashable on Wednesday afternoon that there was in fact an active shooter on the base. A spokesperson told us the police department has an official on scene at Fort Hood, and it was on lockdown.

Fort Hood consists of three sections: the main cantonment, West Fort Hood and North Fort Hood. It's one of the largest military installations in the world. Wednesday's shooting happened in the main cantonment, where the majority of the soldiers live and work.

""Around 20 rounds were shot outside but then the shooter went in to the medical brigade building, according to a soldier on post at Fort Hood,"" USA Today reported shortly after the news first broke of the shooting(Opens in a new window).

News of the shooting immediately brought to mind the deadly rampage on the same base on Nov. 5, 2009, when Maj. Nidal Hasan, who had been an Army psychiatrist, killed 13 people and wounded more than 30 others with a semiautomatic pistol.

Hasan, a Muslim, had been opposed to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Prosecutors and Hasan himself said that he feared being deployed to a warzone and wanted to commit jihad to protect fellow Muslims from American troops.

In his military trial, Hasan chose to represent himself but did not offer a defense. He was convicted on all counts and sentenced to death in August 2013.

An 8.9 magnitude earthquake and subsequent tsunami destroyed many regions of northeastern Japan in March 2011. Three nuclear reactors melted down at a plant in Fukushima as a result of the damage, sending more than 100,000 residents out of a 12-mile evacuation area around the plant.

[seealso slug=""google-earth-before-after""]

Over 350 locals were allowed to re-enter the Miyakoji district of Fukushima as of Tuesday, when government officials decided radiation levels were low enough to deem the area safe for habitation, CBS reported(Opens in a new window).

During the evacuation period, approximately 90 residents were allowed back in their homes if they registered with the Japanese government, according to CBS. The government is currently offering locals a one-time 900,000 yen ($9,000) incentive to move back. It has been providing 100,000 yen ($1,000) a month as compensation, but these payments will stop within a year if an area is deemed safe enough for habitation.

The nuclear disaster was the worst of its kind since Chernobyl in 1986. Despite the government's all-clear and its ongoing decontamination efforts, concerns remain over radiation levels in the Miyakoji district, according to CNN(Opens in a new window). Last month, the Tokyo Electric Power Company reported that 100 metric tons of radioactive water(Opens in a new window) leaked out of a holding tank at the Fukushima plant.

Although three years have passed since the nuclear meltdown, effects of the disaster are still felt, including the realization that many nuclear-power plants are not prepared to deal with such large-scale disasters; this has inspired governments to reassess safety measures at these facilities.

7013338,Google Bus Saga Continues: San Francisco Upholds Plan to Charge Shuttles,"The San Francisco Board of Supervisors voted on Tuesday to uphold a proposed pilot program that will charge commuter tech buses a small fee for using public bus stops to pickup and drop-off employees in San Francisco.

City supervisors voted 8 to 2 to continue plans for the program despite an appeal for an Environmental Impact Report(Opens in a new window) to determine the effects the shuttle program may have on the local environment. Supporters of the program claim it will lead to fewer drivers on the road, and a full scale EIR isn't necessary since the program is a pilot intended for evaluation purposes, not a permanent program. Opponents of the shuttles claim that forgoing an EIR is illegal.

[seealso slug=""tech-shuttling-employees""]

Richard Drury, legal counsel for opponents of the program, including Harvey Milk LGBT Democratic Club, SEIU 1021, The League of Pissed Off Voters, and Housing Rights Committee Executive Director Sara Shortt, says that an EIR is necessary because of the California Environmental Quality Act(Opens in a new window). This act ""requires state and local agencies to identify the significant environmental impacts of their actions and to avoid or mitigate those impacts, if feasible.""

Drury says the city is already conducting an EIR for public transportation improvements for bus and subway routes (called Muni in local parlance), and tech companies should be held to the same standards. The pilot program also plans to add new bus stops, meaning there is little info on how these new stops will impact the environment.

""When we try to improve Muni, Muni has to do a full-on EIR,"" he says. ""But when Google wants to run illegal pirate shuttles, there's no CEQA review at all. That makes no sense whatsoever.""

The pilot program, which was unanimously approved by the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Authority's Board of Directors in January, seeks to charge tech giants $1 per shuttle stop, per day, beginning in July. While commonly referred to as ""Google buses,"" companies like Apple and Facebook are also currently using public bus stops to pick up and drop-off employees free of charge, a system that has resulted in multiple tech bus protests throughout San Francisco over the last few months.

Tech shuttle supporters claim the buses help reduce pollution and traffic congestion by taking cars off the road. Fees from the program will cost companies roughly $80,000 per year, and more than $100,000 for big companies like Google. That means the city should bring in a few million dollars per year through the program.

Google defended its use of the shuttles late Tuesday night by pointing to the number of cars it keeps off the road. â€œWeâ€™re excited to continue working with the city of San Francisco on our shared goal of efficient transportation in the Bay Area,"" a company spokesperson wrote in a statement given to Mashable. ""Googleâ€™s shuttles result in net annual savings of more than 20,000 metric tons of CO2. Thatâ€™s like taking about 4,000 cars off the road every day.""

Tech shuttle opponents claim that private buses clog up city bus routes, pose a risk to bikers, and have contributed to a rapid rate of gentrification within the city. They also claim the $1 per stop, per day charge is too small for these tech companies. Regular citizens who ride public transportation are charged $2 per ride.

Drury says that it is illegal for private vehicles to stop at public bus stops, citing State Vehicle Code 22500(Opens in a new window), an activity which results in a $271 fine for a San Francisco citizen, but only costs tech companies $1 under the proposed shuttle program. The city can't change state law, Drury says, which he claims the MTA did when it passed the proposed shuttle pilot program in January.

The other major issue is gentrification, a point of emphasis for those opposing the shuttle program altogether. Rents in San Francisco have skyrocketed in recent years(Opens in a new window), a fact that many believe has been caused, at least in part, by the influx of highly-paid tech workers who live in San Francisco and commute down to the Peninsula, where Google, Facebook, and Apple are located.

Opponents of the shuttle program claim that commuter shuttles have turned San Francisco into a ""bedroom community,"" pushing out the low and middle-income families with high-salaried tech workers. Drury called San Francisco's Mission neighborhood ""ground zero"" for the gentrification issue, a neighborhood he described as ""55% Latino, people of color, [and] overwhelmingly lower and moderate income.""

""Those people are being displaced,"" he says. ""They will require replacement housing. Either that or they'll live in the street.""

Drury also cited a recent report that found tech buses cause $1 in damages to city roads for each mile they drive. If true, this is much more than the $1-per-stop fee the pilot program is implementing, and 100 times as much damage as done by a typical SUV, says Drury.

Numerous local residents voiced their opinion during the ""public hearing"" section of the meeting, which took almost seven hours. One commenter in a wheelchair claimed the tech shuttles keep the city buses from pulling all the way to the curb, making it harder for disabled residents to use public transit.

""CEQA doesn't mean stop the project,"" Drury said. ""CEQA means study the project before you take action, and when you take action, impose mitigation measures and do it with your eyes wide open.""",4/2/2014 0:00,0.461814,21,15,2,4.350058,6,Entertainment,0,9566.667,3802.687,18325,0.548006,0.105147,0.036173,0.024504,0,0,654
7013117,Greenpeace Blasts 'Dirty' Amazon Web Services,"It may have been a banner day for Amazon on Wednesday with the unveiling of its Fire TV set-top box, but Greenpeace would like to draw your attention to a less visible side of the Jeff Bezos empire.

Amazon Web Services (AWS) is one of the largest cloud computing platforms in the world; it lends its vast server farms to Pinterest, Yelp and Flipboard, not to mention hundreds of Silicon Valley startups. According to Greenpeace's report ""Clicking Clean(Opens in a new window)"" [PDF], released Wednesday, AWS also has one of the largest, dirtiest carbon footprints anywhere in the Internet's infrastructure.

SEE ALSO: 7 Key Findings From the New UN Climate Science Report

The environmental report praises Facebook, Google, Apple, Yahoo and Box for the enormous strides they've made in powering their server farms with energy from renewable sources such as wind, solar and hydroelectric power. (Facebook, Apple and Google were on the naughty list just three years ago.) But it doesn't hesitate to call out the bad boys in the class, most notably AWS -- and, to a lesser extent, Twitter.

The report's authors blast ""Internet companies who have refused to pay even lip service to sustainability, and are simply buying dirty energy straight from the grid. These companies, most notably Amazon Web Services, are choosing how to power their infrastructure based solely on lowest electricity prices, without consideration to the impact their growing footprints have on human health or the environment.""

One chart from the report explains what the pressure group means by that:

Credit: Greenpeace

In a statement to Mashable, Amazon took issue with what it called the report's ""false assumptions"" and ""inaccurate data."" The company said that two of its data centers use 100% carbon-free power. ""We like offering customers the choice of being able to run carbon-free,"" a spokesperson said. ""Running IT infrastructure on the AWS Cloud is inherently more energy efficient than traditional computing.""

But Greenpeace claimed Amazon was being, well, a little cloudy about the whole issue. ""We have no interest in getting Amazon's data wrong, which is why we asked them to share their own data,"" said David Pomerantz, who edited the report. ""Unlike other companies, Amazon declined to do that, so we have used the best public sources we can find"" from governments and local utilities.

""While Amazon is currently using hydropower in Oregon, which is carbon-free, it is growing so fast there that its utility partner has been trying to avoid meeting a state law that requires it to produce more wind and solar energy,"" Pomerantz added. ""If Amazon were acting responsibly, it would partner with its utility to bring more wind and solar to its energy grid, not less"" -- just as Apple and Facebook have done in partnership with Duke Energy in North Carolina.

Clearly, Greenpeace is pushing hard on a strategy of effusive praising and righteous shaming in the tech world. Pomerantz concluded that ""having one hydro-powered data center out of an otherwise vastly dirty energy footprint, based mostly in Virginia on a coal, gas and nuclear powered grid, is a far cry from the ambitious 100% renewable energy goal that peers like Apple, Facebook and Google are pursuing.""

The update is centered mainly on mouse-and-keyboard setups: desktops and laptops. The taskbar -- long a hallmark of the Windows desktop -- gains new prominence with the update. It's now visible in Modern (aka ""Metro"") apps when a user moves the mouse cursor to the bottom of the screen.

[seealso slug=""microsoft-build-2014-preview""]

Users can also pin Modern apps to the taskbar, and the Windows Store is pre-pinned with the update -- both to alert users about the capability and to increase the discoverability of Modern apps.

The Start screen has some more features, too. Right-clicking on a live tile will call up a drop-down menu instead of the ""ribbon"" along the bottom. There are also notifications for freshly installed apps, which are marked with a clear label ""New.""

The new version of Windows includes improvements to Internet Explorer, which will give IT managers more tools to customize capabilities. That way, some legacy enterprise systems will now be compatible with Windows 8.1.

The Windows 8.1 Update, announced in conjunction with Windows Phone 8.1, comes just five months after the previous major upgrade, Windows 8.1 itself. Although Microsoft announced Windows 8.1 in June last year, it didn't debut until October.

7032748,"The More Than/Over Debate Isn't Over, AP","The Associated Press dropped a bomb on the journalism world on Thursday with a tweet announcing a change in the organization's venerable stylebook.

Cue the outrage from journalists and grammar aficionados. The AP upended decades of journalistic tradition in less than 140 characters, and was immediately scorned for grammar heresy.

AP Style tip: New to the Stylebook: over, as well as more than, is acceptable to indicate greater numerical value. #ACES2014(Opens in a new window)â€” AP Stylebook (@APStylebook) March 20, 2014(Opens in a new window)

Prior to the rule change, the only acceptable use of the preposition ""over"" was in reference to physical proximity. For example, you could hold your hands over the piano keys, or hover your mouse over that cute cat picture while you decide whether to Like it on Facebook.

""More than"" was used to express relational quantity with numbers. This is how you would tell the world that Facebook has more than a billion users, or you watched more than your friend did in a House of Cards marathon.

The issue hit home here at Mashable -- two of our editors are at loggerheads over the question of whether ""more than"" is actually an acceptable substitute for ""over."" Takes sides, below. You'll also find our verdict, below.

The case for overlap

By Alex Hazlett, More Than/Over Integrationist

As an editor, the AP Stylebook may be more of a bible for me than the actual Bible. There are certainly more commandments. But in this case, we all just need to calm down. This is a change we should be welcoming, not deploring.

I get it -- the rules change seems to upend The Order of Things. But the anger misses the point; the rule never made sense in the first place. It was an arbitrary style decision that had nothing to do with grammar, defensible only by that rationale of last resort: tradition.

""More than/ over"" is not like the distinction between ""fewer"" and ""less than."" In that case, there's a question of meaning. ""Less than"" refers to things that are uncountable or imprecise: ""I have less free time than my dog,"" or ""I make less than a million dollars."" Saying ""I make fewer than a million dollars"" means that you're actually talking about a couple fewer dollar bills, not just telling me that your salary is lower.

""More than"" and ""over"" have never been this clearly delineated. They've been used interchangeably in certain contexts for decades. In fact, according to Grammar Girl, that SEO-optimized high priestess of online language arts, the only reason that the use of ""more than/over"" was regulated was because New York Evening Post editor William Cullen Bryan preferred it(Opens in a new window). In 1877. More than 137 years later, we're still bowing to that preference. That's all it is: a preference. It's a way for us as journalists to demarcate our tribe and weed out those who aren't in it, which is basically everyone who doesn't use an AP style guide.

There are clearly independent use cases where ""more than"" or ""over"" are each the only acceptable option. We'll still be writing ""the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog,"" ""over my dead body"" and ""Joe exercises more than Tom."" To switch those around would be clearly wrong and isn't what the AP was suggesting. The change covers the cases in the middle, where you want to refer to a greater quantity, and where the words can often be substituted with no loss of meaning. There's nary a difference in writing that ""Lady Gaga has over a million Twitter followers"" instead over ""more than."" The meaning is clear and when you're trying to write tweets and short headlines, five extra characters make a difference.

It's been a debate here at Mashable whether to continue to abide by the old rule or adopt the new. I'm in the minority (population: one) in lobbying for embracing the new rules. Internet journalists, perhaps more than any other kind, occupy the grey area on the cutting edge of language development. The AP hasn't always caught up quickly to words like selfie, YOLO, website and Internet. Style is arbitrary and choosing which language etiquette to adhere to says more about us than it does about language. As someone who helps write about the conversations we have online, I want to be a part of that community and speak like our readers speak (well, write).

I'm as much of a grammar curmudgeon as anyone. It's literally my job, and a specialized knowledge in which I take great pride. But in this case, I'm firmly on the side of the democratic masses, and I can't defend a rule that makes no sense. The AP, despite the nostalgic kerfuffle that's been frothing online, is right on, as usual.

The case against

By Megan Hess, More Than/Over Separatist

Thursday was an emotional day. It began with a gchat from a coworker -- â€œwhoa"" -- and a link to the Poynter(Opens in a new window) post relaying the news that the AP had removed its distinction between â€œmore thanâ€ and ""over.â€

Is nothing sacred? I fumed. My college journalism courses were filled with professors drilling the difference into our heads. Style determines what makes something further or farther, an implication or an inference. Without it, the world turns into a Lord of the Flies-esque dystopia.

But it wasnâ€™t just that J-school loyalty that fueled my fire.

AP editors said â€œoverwhelming usageâ€ of both terms prompted the change. By that reasoning, why not dump the entire AP Stylebook in the garbage? There are plenty of style rules that get overlooked (I can't count the number of times I've seen ""which"" instead of ""that""), but that doesn't mean we should completely disregard them.

The more than/over distinction is a long-heralded one that should not be given up lightly. At the risk of sounding snobbish, the distinction is one that distinguishes clean, precise language and attention to detail -- and serves as a hallmark of a proper journalism training. It denotes a common ground for people who care about the rules; â€œmore thanâ€ refers to numbers and quantities, whereas â€œoverâ€ refers to conceptual amounts and spatial relationships (like ""over the finish line"").

One can argue the distinction is more stylistic than grammatical. And thatâ€™s fine; publications, online or print, should be able to dictate their styles for themselves. Style still holds meaning. Above, Alex argues that the difference is an arbitrary one. By the same token, canâ€™t you argue that â€œeffectâ€ versus â€œaffectâ€ was just an arbitrary letter choice? Over time, however, that difference has accrued meaning to the masses; we shouldn't disregard a century of meaning without a second thought. The same holds true for â€œmore thanâ€ versus â€œover.â€

Merriam-Webster's online dictionary lists several uses of ""over,"" one of which includes ""beyond some quantity, limit, or norm often by a specified amount or to a specified degree,"" with the example phrase ""the show ran a minute over."" None of the example sentences use it in the stead of ""more than,"" which is telling.

As journalists, we should constantly evaluate and analyze our writing practices and whether they make sense; the mere fact that weâ€™ve been doing something forever doesnâ€™t make it right. The AP Stylebook makes updates every year, and I certainly agree with some of its recent changes(Opens in a new window). But in this case, the update was not made to keep up with cultural relevancy (like the AP's addition of YOLO or selfie, as mentioned above). Itâ€™s a change I just canâ€™t get behind, and I'm not alone. Grammar nerds agree.

And now the tirade continues:

Credit: @mhess4

Our style guide at Mashable deviates from the AP in some regards (a recent addition includes ""cockblock"" as one word), and this is one to add to the books. Plus, Fowlerâ€™s Modern English Usage(Opens in a new window) notes that in Britain, â€œoverâ€ has equal status as â€œmore than.â€ Do we really want to abide by the same stylistic norms as a culture that uses colour? I think not.

The verdict

Mashable will continue to distinguish between ""more than"" and ""over,"" despite the AP's recent change.

In the wake of Russia's moves in Ukraine, NASA told Mashable that it plans on decreasing its reliance on the country in order to send humans to space from American soil by 2017.

""Right now everything is normal in our relationship with the Russians,"" Bolden said on March 4. ""Since the International Space Station has been in orbit, it's very important to understand that started with a partnership between the United States and Russia. That partnership in space remains intact and normal.""

Last month, Bolden said NASA would closely monitor the situation with Russia and Ukraine, which continues to intensify after Russia took over Ukraine's Crimea region.

A new crew(Opens in a new window), which includes two Russian cosmonauts and NASA astronaut Steve Swanson, launched to the ISS on a Russian Soyuz rocket on March 25. With a now-defunct shuttle program, NASA's only way of getting humans into space is via Russian rocket.

President Obama has repeatedly warned Russian President Vladimir Putin that the U.S. would take action if Russia invaded Ukraine. So far, Obama has approved sanctions against top Russian officials and supported a hefty aid package for Ukraine's newly formed government. However, Obama has yet to commit any military involvement, and, at this point, it's highly unlikely he'll put American troops on the ground.

This latest move is an unexpected one as the two space agencies have been able to work together peacefully for years. Even Bolden, who reiterated in March that he wasn't worried about the Ukraine situation as it pertains to NASA, worked in space with Russian cosmonauts just a few years after the Cold War.

Subject: Suspension of NASA contact with Russian entities

Dear Colleagues,

Given Russia's ongoing violation of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, until further notice, the U.S. Government has determined that all NASA contacts with Russian Government representatives are suspended, unless the activity has been specifically excepted. This suspension includes NASA travel to Russia and visits by Russian Government representatives to NASA facilities, bilateral meetings, email, and teleconferences or videoconferences. At the present time, only operational International Space Station activities have been excepted. In addition, multilateral meetings held outside of Russia that may include Russian participation are not precluded under the present guidance. If desired, our office will assist in communication with Russian entities regarding this suspension of activities. Specific questions regarding the implementation of this guidance can be directed to Ms. Meredith McKay, 202.358.1240 or [email protected], in our office.

We remain in close contact with the Department of State and other U.S. Government departments and agencies. If the situation changes, further guidance will be disseminated.

""We have built the Lumia 930 for absolute speed and performance,"" said Microsoft's Stephen Elop, who showed off the handset on stage at Build.

The handset will go on sale globally, beginning in Europe, this June and will sell for about $599, before subsidies.

Microsoft also showed off two new lower cost Lumia handsets-- the Lumia 630 and 635. The Nokia Lumia 630 will come in single and dual SIM varieties and be the lowest cost Windows 8.1 device.

7029026,Nike's Dramatic New World Cup Ad Will Give You Chills,"Nike made a new World Cup ad. It's really, really well done. But does it top 2010's iconic spot? That we doubt.

The new spot, embedded above and produced by Wieden+Kennedy, focuses on Portugal's Cristiano Ronaldo, Brazil's Neymar Jr. and England's Wayne Rooney. It shows each steeling himself for a big match and is centered around a premise of ""Risk Everything"" with the tagline, ""Pressure shapes legends.""

The soundtrack, moody lighting and pace all add up to the typically excellent advertising fare we expect from Nike and the creative agency that coined ""Just Do It.""

[seealso url = ""http://mashable.com/2014/04/01/usmnt-1994-world-cup-jerseys""]

But watch the spot again. Notice anything funny? It doesn't actually mention the World Cup at all. The superstar faces, the international jerseys and the overall atmosphere simply nudge us to make that assumption. So why would Nike not want to mention one of the world's biggest sporting events by name? Well, the World Cup is sponsored by one of its chief rivals, Adidas.

Nike did the same omission in its wildly popular ""Write the Future"" spot ahead of the 2010 World Cup. That ad ran three minutes long and played like a miniature surrealist film, showing some of the game's most famous players living out alternately glorious and miserable futures depending on how they performed in important (and fictional) matches.

7013217,"NYT Now: All the News That Fits on Your Mobile Phone, More or Less","As someone old enough to remember life before the web, I still associate The New York Times with a big honking broadsheet, something you hunker down with for a few hours on a Sunday. Compared to easy reads like Newsday or The New York Post, The Times was daunting. During the few times I subscribed to daily delivery, I would feel a creeping sense of guilt as the old copies amassed in my recycling bin, mostly unread.

Since The Times equals ""high-quality, in-depth content"" in my mind, there's a bit of cognitive dissonance regarding its latest move into mobile media. The phone isn't designed for longreads. In this medium, snackable content is the rule. Adapting the Gray Lady to this emerging media landscape has been tricky.

Yet she has no choice: In February, there were about 42 million visitors to nytimes.com(Opens in a new window) according to comScore. Denise Warren, executive vice president of digital products and services, says that something like 30% to 40% of readers come from mobile (mostly phones) on an average day, but on big news days, the number approaches 60%. It's not clear how much traffic comes from Flipboard, which has distributed Times content since 2012.

The Times is attempting to meet this trend head on with NYT Now(Opens in a new window), a new app it released Wednesday on iOS. (Sorry, no Android version yet.) The premise: The best of The Times and some curated content from other sources (including rival The Wall Street Journal) presented in snackable bites. If you're in the market for a 3-minute read to bring you up to speed on the news of the day, this may be just what you're looking for. However, if you were imagining an app that catered the news to your particular interests, you may find NYT Now wanting.

Similarly, if you're already a Times subscriber, this isn't necessarily for you. Warren says the target for this app are people who want more than the allocated free 10-articles-per-month limit on digital, but aren't ready to spend $15 every four weeks for full digital access. At $7.99 for every 28 days, NYT Now is meant to woo these casual readers.

[seealso slug=""nyt-website-redesign""]

(If you're already a subscriber, NYT Now is free. Meanwhile, if you want to go deeper, The Times on Wednesday also introduced Times Premier, which gives you additional content like behind-the-scenes interviews with reporters, ""premier crosswords"" and ebooks for an extra $10 every four weeks. One of this month's titles: The Life and Times of Philip Seymour Hoffman.)

Warren says The Times has done its research and knows that those $8-a-month readers are out there, but I'm not convinced. There are so many news reader apps on the market already with free content, including Flipboard, Facebook's Paper and Google Play Newsstand that it's hard to believe that there's a user whose news needs aren't being met. And if you like Times content that much, why not pay $15 or just keep switching browsers? (Warren says that surprisingly few people exercise this option to get around the 10 articles per month limit.)

The Experience

Like other news apps designed for mobile phones, NYT Now doesn't look anything like a newspaper. There's no front page. Instead there's a not-quite-endless scroll. Atop the scroll is the latest big news story. At 11:30 AM on Wednesday, that was ""Supreme Court Rejects Cap on Donors' Total Gifts in U.S. Races(Opens in a new window)."" If wanted the quick version, there were two paragraphs. For a deeper dive, you could tap on the headline to see the full story.

Credit:

Other big stories Wednesday morning included the Mideast peace talks, a piece on people who bought insurance in the last few months but weren't included in the Affordable Care Act's official tally and another article about police grappling with a rising number of mentally ill citizens. In total, there were 15 stories in the scroll including two opinion pieces. In addition, there were two videos and one ad, from Cartier.

The ads are something new for The Times, ""Paid Posts,"" a.k.a. native advertising. A Times rep says the ad should appear once in the news stream at any given time.

That Cartier ad will also run after every 10 stories in ""Our Picks,"" a second scroll that curates content from elsewhere. On Wednesday, I saw articles from The Detroit News, Philadelphia Magazine and YouTube (a viral video featuring Samuel L. Jackson's slam poem about Boy Meets World.)

Of the two feeds, Our Picks featured much more varied content and was updated more often. It's your dessert after wading through the more sober news feed.

There are some other neat features. If you see a story that interests you but don't have time to read it, you can save it to read later. Clifford Levy, the editor of NYT Now, says there will also be several special updates throughout the day. At 6 am, you can see the morning update. Then there's a lunchtime read from noon to 2 and then a nighttime read from 9 pm to midnight.

Levy says those times will adjust to your phone's clock. So if you fly to Los Angeles, for instance, the morning update will come at 6 am PST. However, that just applies to U.S. travel. If you're in, say, China, you're not going to see the lunchtime read at noon local time.

When asked why a consumer would use NYT Now vs. any of the other free apps out there, Levy said the human touch was the key. ""This is an app that's curated by humans,"" he says. ""It's not done by an algorithm that's shoveling you stuff."" Those humans -- about 15 in all -- will be working around the clock to find appropriate content for the app. Though there's a smaller staff at night, someone will always be on duty, Levy says.

The other selling point is Times content, Levy says. ""At the heart of this app is great New York Times journalism,"" he says.

Utility

There's no doubt that The New York Times remains one of the most trusted news brands in the world. However, when it comes to stories like the Supreme Court ruling referenced above, you don't necessarily need The Times' version to get the gist.

Digital media has had a flattening effect on brands like The Times. At this point, it's safe to say most readers care more about the story they're reading than the source. Luckily, The Times has a lot of great content at its disposal. For me, though, there's not much utility to NYT Now unless I can customize the news feed. I have an insatiable appetite for tech and business news, for instance, and if I knew NYT Now would reliably deliver such info to my phone, then I'd be an enthusiastic supporter.

However, in my experience, if there's huge breaking news outside of business and tech, it usually finds me.

That said, I'll be watching NYT Now. Levy said that in tests, consumers tended to just read news on their mobile phones in the mornings. In the afternoon, they'd drift off to games and social media. However, The Times found that NYT Now users tended to habitually tune into the curated feed late in the day.",4/2/2014 0:00,0.301168,15,2,0,4.421971,7,Tech,1671.554,4675.052,3036.964,0,0.477565,0.072323,0.039014,0.020192,0,0,8600
7032910,When Raspberry Pi Isn't Enough: Behold the Open Source Laptop,"Raspberry Pi made waves in recent years as a computer that you can buy for just $35. It's tiny, though, and its built-in capabilities are limited. Is there anything in the same spirit, but with more actual hardware?

That's pretty much the question Chumby designer Andrew ""Bunnie"" Huang asked. Finding the current answers unsatisfying, he set out to create a new kind of computer: an open source laptop.

[seealso slug=""robotics-breakthroughs""]

""I've been a hacker of consumer electronics,"" Huang told Mashable. ""I find myself typically designing products I don't use. I decided I wanted to design something I wanted to use.""

So what exactly is an open source laptop? Named Novena, it's a Linux-powered machine where every component can be modified by the user. Anyone who owns one will be able to rewire and reprogram individual components -- the source code of each one will be available. And the actual casing, unlike most laptops, is made to be opened up and tinkered with.

""It's meant to have an easy and accessible approach to electronics on the inside,"" Huang says. ""You can actually download the design source. You can understand the intent of every component.""

Obviously, Novena is for hackers only, and Huang says he doesn't expect there will be a lot of demand. His crowdfunding campaign, hosted by Crowd Supply, is seeking $250,000, but since each laptop will cost about $2,000 in contributions, he doesn't expect to move more than a couple hundred.

""Making more of them isn't a problem,"" he says. ""The trick is making less of them. What we're hoping is to make enough money to develop the next generation of this.""

So who would want a fully programmable laptop? Huang says researchers, engineers and product developers all would have interest, but also anyone concerned about security. Since the owner can drill down as far as they want into components, there's an ""enhanced level of inspectability,"" he points out.

The campaign on Crowd Supply(Opens in a new window) begins today and runs until May 18.",4/2/2014 0:00,0.666667,15,12,0,4.644068,6,00000,0,8537.597,3702.843,1700,0.632718,0.191667,0.059322,0.021186,0.65,0.35,846
7032701,Fly Like a Giant Prehistoric Lizard With Kinect-Powered Simulator,"Don't let the silent ""p"" fool you: Pterosaurs are not dinosaurs.

They're not quite birds or bats, either. If anything, they're more like a unique breed of flying reptiles(Opens in a new window), ranging in width from the size of a sparrow to that of a two-seater airplane.

They're also dead. Have been for almost 66 million years. But in their prime, scientists say, they were rulers of the sky.

In honor of the late winged kings, the American Museum of Natural History(Opens in a new window) in New York is opening up an exhibit, ""Pterosaurs: Flight in the Age of the Dinosaurs,"" that showcases all-new research, fossils and life-size models of the mysterious species.

The coolest part: Visitors can step into motion sensor-based platforms and pilot two different species of pterosaurs through virtual landscapes.

What makes pterosaurs so interesting is their unique anatomy. To date, no animals remotely resemble them. Pterosaurs first appeared more than 220 million years ago and lived alongside dinosaurs in the Mesozoic Era. They evolved from land-dwelling reptiles, the first vertabrate animals to evolve powered flight, and diversified into more than 150 species over a 150-million-year period, up until their mysterious extinction 66 million years ago.

They had four fingers, one of which extended almost the entirety of each wing.

""And their heads were just massive,"" says Michael Habib, Ph.D., assistant professor of cell and neurobiology at the University of Southern California and co-researcher for the exhibit, which features fossils from Italy, Germany, China and Brazil. ""We like to joke that they were basically flying heads.""

Big-headed, flying crocodile hybrids with wings as wide as fighter jets. (Sleep well tonight, kids!)

The highlight of it all, though, is the flight simulators. Using an Xbox Kinect, visitors can step up in front of a screen and flap their arms; on screen a giant, virtual pterosaur corresponds to their every move. There are two games: one where you try to catch bugs in a dense forest, and another where you try to snag fish from the sea.

The entire program was designed using Unity. Habib, also an expert in flight mechanics, provided the algorithms -- or ""math magic,"" he jokes -- to translate the user's motions as accurately as possible to the virtual bird.

""The speed of how fast you flap your arms will determine how fast the bird climbs,"" he says. ""Given everything we've studied, we believe it's very similar to what worked for the pterosaur.""

But there's one obvious question: If pterosaurs really were ""kings of the sky,"" as they're being pegged, why did they go extinct 66 million years ago?

Alexander Kellner, Ph.D., an associate professor at the Universidade Federal in Rio de Janerio and co-researcher for the exhibit, throws his hands in the air and smiles: ""We don't know! But hopefully we'll find out soon. For now, everyone can enjoy the discoveries we've made so far.""

The exhibition will stay at the Museum of Natural History in New York from April 5 - Jan. 4, 2015. (P)treat yourself to a visit if you're in town.

You can follow her on Instagram @ramshackleglam(Opens in a new window).

For several days last week, RamshackleGlam.com(Opens in a new window) â€“- the domain name that I have owned and operated since March of 2010 â€“- did not belong to me, but rather to a man who goes by the name â€œbahbouhâ€ on an auction website called Flippa.com(Opens in a new window), and who was attempting to sell off the site to the highest bidder (with a â€œBuy It Nowâ€ price of $30,000.00). He promised the winner my traffic, my files, and my data, and suggested that I was available â€œfor hireâ€ to continue writing posts (alternatively, he was willing to provide the winner with â€œhigh-quality articlesâ€ and â€œSEO adviceâ€ to maintain the siteâ€™s traffic post-sale).

I learned that my site was stolen on a Saturday. Three days later I had it back, but only after the involvement of fifty or so employees of six different companies, middle-of-the-night conferences with lawyers, FBI intervention, and what amounted to a sting operation that probably should have starred Sandra Bullock instead ofâ€¦wellâ€¦me.

Of course Iâ€™ve heard of identity theft, and of cyber hacking, but honestly, my attitude towards these things was very much â€œit could never happen to me.â€ And even if it didâ€¦I didnâ€™t exactly understand why it was such a huge deal. Couldnâ€™t you just explain to people what had happened, prove who you were, and sort it all out? We live in such a highly documented world, it seemed completely impossible to me that someone could actually get away with pretending to be someone else with any real consequences beyond a few phone calls and some irritation.

Itâ€™s much, much worse â€“ more threatening, more upsetting, and more difficult (if not impossible) to fix â€“ than Iâ€™d ever imagined.

I found out about the hacking from my father. His friend Anthony (who is his partner at Pro Italia Online(Opens in a new window) and who runs a web development and consulting company called ThoughtBox(Opens in a new window)) had been surfing around on Flippa and had â€“ in an impossibly lucky coincidence â€“ noticed that my site was up for auction, with what appeared to be a highly suspicious listing. Suddenly, I remembered the email I had gotten the day before â€“ an email that I had disregarded as spam â€“ from someone â€œinterested in the purchaseâ€ of my â€œweblogâ€. I remembered the notification from YouTube that someone had accessed my account from a different location â€“ a notification I had ignored, assuming that I had logged in on a mobile device or that my husband had accidentally logged into my account instead of his own.

But even after I saw the listing, I didnâ€™t panic: this seemed like something that could be fixed with a couple of emails. Except the auction site was located in Australia and didnâ€™t appear to have a phone number, and when I sent an email with a scanned ID and proof of ownership what I got back was a form letter. And when I called HostMonster, the site I pay to operate my website, I discovered that I was no longer the owner of my site: someone had used their email confirmation system to authorize the transfer of my domain name into a private account at GoDaddy (another web registrar service of whom Iâ€™m also a client).

Why is this a big deal?

If you have a business that depends on a URL, you understand why this was such upsetting news: With control over my websiteâ€™s domain name, a hacker would be able to take the site down, or redirect it elsewhere. Further, it was later verified that the hacker had control over all of the siteâ€™s content, as well; he could have just rerouted everything Iâ€™ve ever written to any location he wanted.

Ramshackle Glam may be â€œjustâ€ a lifestyle blog about things like parenting and fashion and decorâ€¦but itâ€™s also a site that Iâ€™ve spent five years of my life building, and the idea of it falling into the hands of someone with malicious intent was heartbreaking. I could switch to a new URL and export a copy of my content (which I do back up), but that would result in the loss of a substantial amount of traffic. The website is my primary source of income, and with a house(Opens in a new window), a child(Opens in a new window), another child(Opens in a new window) on the way, a book(Opens in a new window) coming out this week, and a husband in business school(Opens in a new window), this was not a joke. The loss of my URL had the potential to be devastating for my business and for my family in a very real way.

So what did I do?

The events of the next few days were complicated, so rather than go through them chronologically Iâ€™m going to explain how each path I took ended up panning out (Iâ€™m going into detail so that I can be as much help as possible to anyone who goes through this themselves).

1. I tried to resolve the situation directly with GoDaddy and HostMonster. This did not work. From Sunday through Tuesday, I spent most of the day (and much of the night) on the phone with GoDaddy, HostMonster, or both at the same time, and nearly every person I spoke with gave me the same response: â€œSorry, canâ€™t help you.â€

HostMonster maintained that because they no longer controlled the domain name, there was nothing they could do. GoDaddy maintained that because the account was private and the person had obtained ownership of the domain through a transfer from HostMonster, there was nothing they could do.

What finally made a difference: I cited ICANNâ€™s policy on Domain Name Dispute Resolution(Opens in a new window). This got my case upgraded, but it did not result in action.

Hereâ€™s why: the legal department at HostMonster informed me that in order for them to initiate a transfer dispute that would result in GoDaddy releasing the domain back to me, their â€œinternal investigationâ€ would have to turn up evidence that they had done something wrong in releasing the site. In other words, they would have to admit that they had screwed upâ€¦which would in turn open them up to a lawsuit.

Needless to say, I never heard from the legal department again. Despite the fact that everyone seemed clear on the fact that I owned my website and that it had been transferred without my authorization, nothing was going to be done unless I initiated a time-consuming and costly lawsuit that, in any case, would not result in action quick enough to save my domain name from being sold.

So that avenue came to an end.

If your domain is transferred without your authorization, tell the support staff answering the registrar hotline that you have a TEAC situation and that you need to speak with a supervisor immediately, then cite ICANN policy to initiate an investigation.

2. I called the FBI. This was a major step in the right direction. The morning after I found out about the unauthorized transfer, I also called the FBI. I felt silly and dramatic making the phone call, but the reality is that this is an international cyber crime issue, and thatâ€™s FBI territory. And this is my business. Itâ€™s how I support my family, and it may be a â€œsmall matterâ€ in the grand scheme of things, but it is not a small matter to me.

And let me tell you: of all the surprises Iâ€™ve had over the past week or so, most surprising of all has been the FBI. They responded immediately, with follow-up phone calls and emails, an in-person interview with two special agents at my own home within 24 hours, and a follow-up visit from two agents yesterday. Beyond that, each and every agent I have interacted with over the past week has been, without fail, compassionate, thoughtful, invested, respectful, and committed to actionâ€¦in addition to treating me not like a case number, but like a human.

What I expected was to leave a message with a general mailbox and at some point receive a form letter; I certainly did not expect to see an active investigation opened immediately. Iâ€™m not going to write more about the investigation because itâ€™s still ongoing (although I did ask for and receive permission to write about this), but I think itâ€™s important to say how absolutely blown away I have been by the FBIâ€™s response.

3. I tried to regain control by dealing directly with the â€œsellerâ€. This worked, but not without considerable drama.

While all of the above was going on, I was also working to regain control over the site directly from the individual who was trying to sell it.

I didnâ€™t want to contact the â€œsellerâ€ directly, because I felt that if he thought the â€œrealâ€ owner of the site was aware of the sale, he would try to extort more money. So I asked Anthony â€“ the person who had found the original listing, and who had an active account with a positive history on Flippa â€“ to DM â€œbahbouhâ€ to see if he was interested in a â€œprivate saleâ€. After some back-and-forth we reached an agreement, and it was decided that a third-party money-transfer website (Escrow.com(Opens in a new window)) would be used to make the sale: the money would only be released to the seller upon confirmation that the domain name had been transferred.

This appeared to be going smoothly until Tuesday night, when the seller suddenly demanded that the funds be released immediately (prior to receipt of the website). When we pushed back, he announced that he was selling it to someone else: â€œSorry, bye.â€

So here was my thought process: if we did not release the money to the seller, we were guaranteed to not get the website. If we did release the money to him, there was a possibility that he would take the money and run, and also a possibility that he would deliver the site as promised. It wasnâ€™t a gamble I wanted to takeâ€¦but I didnâ€™t see any option. And so I authorized the wire transfer.

I spent twenty minutes sitting in front of the dummy GoDaddy account I had created to receive the domain name from the seller, waiting to see whether I was out thousands of dollars and a domain name, or just thousands of dollars.

And then it came through.

I immediately transferred the domain into a different account and placed it (and all of my other domain names) on what amounted to lockdown. And then I called the wire transfer company and placed a stop on the payment.

The end result

RamshackleGlam.com is back in my possession, thanks to a number of people who dedicated hours (in some cases days) out of their lives to doing whatever they could to help me. My other accounts â€“ bank accounts, et cetera â€“ have been secured. I donâ€™t have my money back yet, but the man who stole my site from me doesnâ€™t have it, either, and wonâ€™t be getting it, ever.

And thatâ€™s an ending Iâ€™m pretty damn thrilled with.

So why am I still angry?

Of course Iâ€™m angry with the person or people who stole the site, but thatâ€™s out of my hands. The reason Iâ€™m writing this post is to let people know that this really can happen â€“ to anyone â€“ and to offer suggestions for how to minimize the chances that it will happen to you (below), but beyond that, Iâ€™m writing this post because this incident made me very, very angry at GoDaddy and HostMonster. And I want you to know why.

No one at either company questioned my statement (supported by written proof) that the website belonged to me. No one doubted that it had been transferred without my authority. And yet I had to spend days â€“ days during which the hacker could have done virtually anything he wanted â€“ trying to reach one single person who was able to do anything, because the support staff and supervisors I spoke with (who had to have numbered fifty or more) were completely uninformed as to how to handle this situation beyond saying, â€œJeez, that sucks. Canâ€™t help you.â€

And once I reached people who could help me â€“- who could literally make a single phone call or push a single button and return my property to me (or simply freeze it so that it could not be sold or destroyed) â€“- they would not. They hid behind their legal departments and refused to do anything, knowing full well that their inaction would force me to either interact with and pay off a criminal, or lose an essential component of my business.

And hackers know that these companies will do this.

They rely on it.

There is a serious problem when a criminal enterprise not only exists â€œdespiteâ€ a companyâ€™s policies, but actually thrives as a direct result of that companyâ€™s prioritization of their own interests over the security of the clients they allegedly â€œprotectâ€. Do I understand why companies like HostMonster and GoDaddy are focused on protecting themselves against lawsuits? Of course I do. But the fact is that they not only do not â€œhelpâ€ their customers, but actively contribute to creating situations that threaten small businesses and the families that they support.

And these companies know that when they stonewall clients whose property has obviously been stolen that these clients will have no other recourse than to pay off criminals or watch their businesses â€“ sometimes their very lives - collapse. They know that by standing in the way of immediate action they create the very environment that these criminals depend upon to perpetuate their business model. And they do nothing.

This has to change.

My opinion, for what it's worth

Support personnel at hosting companies should be made intimately familiar with ICANN regulations involving domain disputes, and should be able to initiate a plan of action the first time a client makes them aware of a situation, not after hours and hours of repeated calls.

Further, the establishment of a TEAC should result in an immediate freeze on the account in dispute until the situation has been resolved. This should not require an admission of culpability on the part of any parties; simply an acknowledgement that a dispute exists and an awareness that while the dispute exists the domain must be held safe from sale or transfer.

What you can do to reduce the chances that this will happen to you:

Have a really, really good password, and change it often. Your password should not contain â€œrealâ€ words (and definitely not more than one real word in immediate proximity, like â€œwhitecatâ€ or â€œangrybirdâ€), and should contain capital letters, numbers and symbols. The best passwords of all look like total nonsense.

If possible, use a separate computer (an old one or a cheap one purchased for this purpose) for things like banking; if your family computer is the same one that you use for bank transactions you risk having your kids click on a bad link that results in a hacking.

Turn off your computer and personal devices when theyâ€™re not in use.

Have antivirus software on your computer (but remember that virus scans only catch 30-40% of viruses, so unfortunately a â€œcleanâ€ check doesnâ€™t necessarily mean that youâ€™re safe).

Purchase CyberRisk Insurance(Opens in a new window) (learn more about it here; it basically protects businesses from cyber attacks and data breaches).

But if it does happen to you, here's what to do:

Begin taking careful notes (and screenshots) immediately. Donâ€™t delete any emails or other information; it could all be important later on.

Immediately change all of your passwords (including â€“ but not limited to â€“ domain registrar, website hosting, website login information, email, bank accounts, wireless home electronics, and Apple ID) according to the rules stated below. I changed mine every few hours while this situation was still up in the air, and am continuing to change them every few days for the time being.

Contact the registrar(s), citing the ICANN policy below, and see if together you can arrive at a speedy resolution. Donâ€™t be surprised if you find yourself running into dead ends.

7025976,You Can Barely See Through the Smog in the UK and France Right Now,"Dangerously poor air quality conditions are affecting London and other parts of Europe due to a noxious mix of Saharan dust and urban air pollution sources. Residents of London have reported a red layer of dust that accumulated on all surfaces in the city following weekend rains.

The poor air quality in London as well as Brussels, Paris and Amsterdam, poses health risks to individuals with suppressed immune systems, respiratory ailments, and the young and elderly, in particular. Due to the combination of dust and urban pollution from cars, power plants and factories, the UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) said the Air Quality Index has spiked to its highest, and most dangerous, level of ten(Opens in a new window) across south England, the Midlands and East Anglia. The Air Quality Index is based on measurements of nitrous oxide, sulphur dioxide and ozone, among other pollutants.

At such a high level, DEFRA advises adults and children with lung problems, adults with heart problems, and older people, to ""avoid strenuous physical activity.""

The air quality problems comes just two weeks after Paris experienced a multi-day air quality crisis, during which officials had to take measures to discourage driving, such as by making the city's vast public transportation system free to use.

A satellite operated by the European satellite agency EUMETSAT captured the Saharan dust being swallowed up by a storm that swept into northwest Africa, Spain, France and the UK during the last three days of March. The winds associated with this storm transported the dust 2,000 miles northward, according to the UK Met Office, which is the equivalent of the National Weather Service in the U.S.

â€œWe usually see this happen several times a year when big dust storms in the Sahara coincide with southerly winds to bring that dust here. More dust rain is possible during showers expected later this week,â€ the Met Office's Paul Hutcheon wrote in a blog post(Opens in a new window).

Credit: U.K. Met Office.

Hutcheon says that winds of at least 20 miles per hour are required to lift Saharan sand to high altitudes, and in this case, winds were gusting above 40 miles per hour. ""Saharan dust is also a contributing factor to air quality in addition to pollution levels and weather conditions,"" Hutcheon says.

Saharan dust can affect far more than just European air quality. By hitching a ride with high altitude winds, dust can be carried across the North Atlantic Ocean during the summer Atlantic hurricane season. When high amounts of dust are present, hurricane formation(Opens in a new window) tends to be suppressed, because the dust interacts with cloud droplets in ways that prevent organized areas of thunderstorms from forming and transitioning into tropical storms and hurricanes.

An unusually high amount of Saharan dust was implicated as one of the causes of 2013's unexpectedly quiet Atlantic hurricane season, for example.

In Europe, the dust is expected to diminish during the next few days, easing some of the pollution problems.",4/2/2014 0:00,0.69697,4,0,1,4.409639,9,Entertainment,0,6150,3509.844,3866.667,0.445538,-0.0116,0.042169,0.048193,0.333333,0.25,12200

Name: Screwpulp(Opens in a new window)

One-Liner Pitch: Screwpulp helps indie authors find an audience with pricing driven by demand.

Why It's Taking Off: Readers can download free books in exchange for reviewing them, and as reviews and download rack up, book price increases translating into better earnings for writers.

The music industry was democratized by YouTube and Soundcloud, news by Reddit and Twitter and many other categories by Kickstarter. But for first-time authors, the publishing industry is still very top-down and although it's easier than ever to self-publish a book, finding readers who will buy it doesn't always follow.

Screwpulp(Opens in a new window) launched last year to help independent authors get their books in front of readers and the site now has 70 books from 55 authors, and just raised(Opens in a new window) its first round of funding. The site allows authors to list their books as a free download in all major ereader formats, and readers that download a free book must review it before downloading another free book. This engagement loop forces honest feedback to the author, which Screwpulp co-founder Richard Billings says not only helps curate books for readers but could inform writers.

[seealso slug=""tumblrs-for-readers""]

If you give away 25 books and get 10 negative reviews, he says, maybe it's an indication that the book needs more work (but could be re-listed at a later date). It's a method similar to what entrepreneurs refer to as ""fail fast.""

The commitment to honest reviews also means the best books will rise to the top, while 'early adopter' readers benefit from a better price.

The goal for Screwpulp is to find the sweet spot in pricing -- for some books, that will be $3, and for others it could be $10. After a book is downloaded 25 times, the price goes from free to $1, and up from there based on demand. Authors keep 75% of sales on Screwpulp, compared to 40-70% on Amazon(Opens in a new window).

""This is a twister with teeth,"" Roker said, describing a ""sharknado.""

Though this news sounds like another April Fools' Day joke, two representatives at NBC confirmed to Mashable that Lauer and Roker's cameos are real.

Sharknado premiered on Syfy in July 2013 to much fanfare on social media, attracting 318,232 tweets during the broadcast and peaking at 5,000 tweets per minute. Its initial broadcast attracted 1.4 million viewers, but the made-for-TV movie had a longer than anticipated shelf life, sparked by its continuously growing social buzz. An encore showing netted 1.9 million viewers, while a third broadcast garnered 2.1 million.

The TV movie eventually made its way to theaters for a special one-time midnight showing, although it reportedly raked in less than $200,000(Opens in a new window) at cinemas.

Syfy is capitalizing on the social success by giving Twitter users the opportunity to name the sequel.

Sharknado 2, directed by Anthony C. Ferrante, will also feature Kelly Osbourne as a flight attendent, Judd Hirsch as a cab driver, Andy Dick as a police officer, Judah Friedlander, Vivica A. Fox as Fin's high school friend and Mark McGrath as Fin's brother-in-law.

7013065,7 Reasons We'd Choose Smartphones Over Cars,"If you had to decide, which would you rather live without -- your car, or your smartphone?

RepairPal(Opens in a new window), which gathers information on auto repair services, polled more than 2,500 people during its second annual Car Care survey and discovered that 86% of respondents would choose their cars over smartphones.

[seealso slug=""smartphone-dependency""]

Approximately 58% of folks trust sites such as Yelp when picking out auto repair shops. However, going to get repairs gives them anxiety; 25% would rather sacrifice their phones for a week instead of getting their cars repaired, while 18% would rather buy a new car altogether instead of going to the shop.

Though phones seem to cause less anxiety, people still don't want to part ways with their automobiles. But in a constantly connected world, is giving up your smartphone really the most practical option?

Here are seven reasons we would pick our smartphones over our cars any day.

1. They help us connect.

Credit: Graham Keen

Imagine driving alone at night on a dark road. Your car suddenly starts to sputter and comes to a shuddering halt. You're stranded, and your car is out of gas. What do you do? You pull out your phone and call for help. And if you don't have a phone? Well, that AAA membership probably won't come in handy. Here's hoping somebody stops on the side of the road to lend you a hand.

Aside from worst-case scenarios, how would you ever reach out to friends or family? And would you even remember their phone numbers? Smartphones keep us connected more than we even realize.

2. They guide us.

Credit: Mike Lau

It's difficult to imagine traveling to new places without our smartphones grasped firmly in hand. Mobile maps help us navigate the entire world around us. Cars might have GPS systems, but there's nothing like having your smartphone everywhere you go.

3. They're more affordable.

Credit: 401 (K) 2012

Phones cost less than cars for a number of obvious reasons, and it's much easier to get your hands on a high-quality model than it is to get a high-quality car. Compare monthly phone service costs with monthly car payments, and it becomes even more evident.

Approximately 49% of people surveyed said that unexpected automotive costs were the top cause of financial anxiety, alongside fear of unemployment.

4. They're easier to fix.

Credit: Frank Jania

Having to fix phone issues is a drag, but it's a fraction of the cost of automotive repairs. If your phone breaks completely, a few hundred bucks (though not an inconsequential sum of money) will get you a new one. If your car breaks down, replacements will cost upward of thousands of dollars.

5. Because Internet.

Credit: hdzimmermann

Anything is possible when you have the Internet at your fingertips. You can find a cab, figure out your local transportation system and so much more. Aside from car-related items, you can just do so much stuff on the web, it's impossible to quantify. Endless possibilities.

6. You're less likely to get into accidents.

Credit: Adam Fagen

In most cases, driving a car is a lot more dangerous than using a cellphone. In addition, someone else using a smartphone in our path isn't as potentially dangerous as being on the road with a reckless driver. Texting while walking may be hazardous and ill-advised, but it has nothing on the fatalities that occur behind the wheel.

7. It's more than just a phone.

That sounds like a tagline for a new mobile device, but it's true. Smartphones have an incredibly vast number of capabilities. They're cameras, web browsers, application hosts, MP3 players, social media hubs and more.

One of the major focal points of the redesign is around content and discoverability. The dark theme -- which is similar to Beats Music -- was specifically chosen to make content really ""pop"" within the app and to put cover art and other iconography front and center.

7013059,The Affordable Desk That Could Make Standing at the Office Mainstream,"Standing up for health just got a little cheaper.

Despite all the talk about how sitting is the new smoking(Opens in a new window), it can be difficult to find someone who actually bucks office norms to work standing up.

One of the hurdles -- price -- is addressed in Wednesday's Kickstarter launch(Opens in a new window) of Stand Desk(Opens in a new window), which starts at $400 and is automatic, meaning it can be used at sitting or standing height and adjusts at the press of a button. Stand Desk reached its Kickstarter goal of $50,000 in 38 minutes.

[seealso slug=""thinnest-iphone-cases/""]

But the difficulty with standing desks isn't the hardware. If you work from home, you're able to set up your workspace however you like, but for someone working in a shared office, it might be more difficult -- and perhaps throw off the floor plan design -- to introduce a standing desk to the mix.

It does help that Stand Desk is automatic, and thus does not require any hands-on cranking or adjusting to bring it to standing position. A user could potentially stand for two hours out of the day, and then return to sitting, without being a distraction to officemates.

Credit:

Mashable previously covered the high-end Stir Kinetic Desk, which runs upwards of $3,890 and prompts users to stand or sit based on a personalized algorithm. Most automatic sit-to-stand desks run in the upper $1,000s.

Stand Desk made its product affordable by simplifying the mechanics that go into raising and lowering the height, with a range of 28 to 45 inches, which should accommodate people as tall as 6'3"". The desk top is made of bamboo or particle board.

We've heard of people building a static standing desk(Opens in a new window) for as low as $200, although it would be static and require standing for the full day. Another option would be to purchase a bar stool, drafting chair or the seat from Focal Upright(Opens in a new window), which allows you to lean onto a seat while using a desk at standing height.

Alternatively, someone with ample office space could purchase both a standing desk and a regular height desk to alternate throughout the day.

Even the biggest proponents of standing desks don't recommend standing for the full eight hours each day, but rather, moving around and alternating between sitting, standing or leaning. In fact, the key isn't choosing standing over sitting, but rather, changing one's posture every 20 to 40 minutes, which NASA researcher Dr. Joan Vernikos (and Stand Desk advisor) found was more beneficial to a person's health than daily exercise in a study done for astronauts. LUMOback founder Monisha Perkash agrees -- in a previous interview, she noted activity outside work cannot make up for poor posture throughout the day.

Users of standing desks recommend you also invest in an anti-fatigue mat(Opens in a new window). A friend of mine who uses a standing desk in his home office says standing on a yoga mat can work as well.

7010193,Tesla Drivers' In-Dash Web Browsing Habits Revealed,"The race is on to snag the attention of drivers via new Internet-enabled dashboard touchscreens, but metrics on exactly how popular this new browsing experience might be have largely been a mystery, until now.

Quantcast has released numbers from a study conducted over a 30-day period designed to give us some insight into the in-dash usage habits of Tesla owners.

[seealso slug=""free-tethering-apps""]

The study, which gleaned stats from 100 million digital destinations over a 30-day period between Feb. 24 and March 23, offers a rough sketch of what the average Tesla owner's in-dash usage looks like.

""This data is based on websites using Quantcast Measure for their audience measurement,"" a Quantcast spokesperson told Mashable. ""The Tesla browser has an identifier called a user agent, similar to a Chrome or Firefox browser. We looked at all visits to measured websites from the Tesla browser.""

Predictably, usage of the 17-inch in-dash touchscreen peaks during typical commuting times, in this case, 7:30 a.m. to 9:30 a.m. and 4:30pm to 7:30 p.m., respectively.

Overall, the study found that news sites comprised the largest usage of Tesla's in-dash screen, making up 54% of the websites visited. After news, services (restaurants, finding/purchasing entertainment, auto-related services, real estate, travel, shopping) accounted for 15% of the usage, followed by entertainment (14%) and lifestyle (12%).

Within the news vertical, the study(Opens in a new window) found that 26%, or roughly half of the news consumption views, were devoted to local news sites, a possible shot in the arm to beleaguered local news ventures like Patch.

Quantcast's study also found that 13% of the news consumed was financial in nature. Interestingly, the study also found that the conservative news aggregation site the DrudgeReport(Opens in a new window) accounted for 10% of overall web browsing traffic.

This can be taken in a couple of ways, depending on how you parse the data. Either it means that Tesla owners, generally affluent at this point, lean conservative, or it could just be attributed to the quick loading, bare-bones design of the DrudgeReport website.

Credit: Quantcast

Another interesting data point from the study reveals how usage of the Tesla tracks across the U.S. According to Quantcast's data, California is the leading source of browser views at 66%, followed by Georgia at 9%, Texas at 8% and New York and Illinois at 5% each.

What's most interesting about Quantcast's data is that it exists at all. There are numerous laws on the books in various U.S. states prohibiting the use of television screens in cars while driving. So, yes, a touchscreen tablet-style dashboard isn't a television, but it could be reasonably argued that it might be just as distracting during web browsing sessions.

In California, the state with the most web browsing activity, according to the study, the law states(Opens in a new window):

It is unlawful to drive a motor vehicle equipped with a television receiver, a video monitor, or a television or video screen, or any other similar means of usually displaying a television broadcast if the receiver is located in the vehicle at any point forward of the back of the driverâ€™s seat.

However, the law makes exceptions for windshield and dashboard-mounted GPS devices and ""systems designed to prevent the driver from viewing them."" But neither of those exceptions describes the kind of in-dash touchscreen used in the Tesla.

In the next most popular web content viewing state in the study, Georgia, no such restriction exists. But in all the other states listed in the study, including Texas, Illinois, Washington, Ohio, New York, Washington, D.C., the laws regarding screens in cars are largely similar(Opens in a new window) to those in California -- no distracting screens allowed while driving.

Although the Tesla's dashboard screen does not have the ability to display web video, on Tesla's own user forums(Opens in a new window), some owners of the vehicle openly admit that the vehicle's in-dash screen can indeed be distracting.

In response to the growing use of media-rich mobile devices, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) released voluntary guidelines last year(Opens in a new window). The agency's guidelines recommend that vehicles be ""stopped and in park"" during situations involving ""the display of certain types of text, including text messages, web pages, social media content.""

Of course, the dashboard computer industry is still so young that we're likely to see even more guidelines crop up in the coming years. For now, we can only hope that the stats from Quantcast's study represent instances in which the vehicles were in park.

And while Quantcast's study is limited in size and duration, it nevertheless offers a hitherto unseen peek into how these new screens (including Apple's CarPlay and Ford's Sync) will really be used.",4/2/2014 0:00,0.520376,2,1,0,4.535385,7,Tech,0,3628.668,2029.653,1300,0.394667,0.100332,0.030769,0.012308,0,0,7800

7013017,"Microsoft: Yes, We're Bringing Back the Start Menu","In a surprise announcement, Microsoft said it would bring back the Start Menu to the Windows desktop. It's not a part of the coming Windows 8.1 Update, but will come in a future upgrade.

Microsoft's Terry Myerson showed off the new version of the Start Menu to an audience of developers at Build 2014 as he explained that users would be able to find apps via the menu. Users would also be able to run Modern (aka ""Metro"") apps within windows on the desktop.

[seealso slug=""http://mashable.com/2014/04/02/windows-phone-8-1""]

In a demo, Myerson showed that the new Start Menu looks similar to as it did in Windows 7, but it includes a minimized version of the Start screen right beside it.

The Start Menu's return follows Microsoft's announcement that apps across all its consumer platforms can now be ""universal,"" meaning they will run across phones, tablets and PCs with little to no re-coding.

For developers, universal Windows apps have clear benefits. It means a developer needs only create a Windows app once, then make minimal adjustments to them to optimize the experience for devices with different screens and capabilities, since the platforms share APIs, security and other resources.

For users, the benefit is a consistent experience across every device they have running Windows software. Another plus: You won't have to buy the app again and again if you want it on both your phone and tablet.

Microsoft said the Xbox One would also be able to run universal Windows apps, although it didn't give a timeframe.

Microsoft also announced new tools for to help develop apps across other platforms, introducing WinJS, or Windows library for javascript, an open-source resource that will help developers make Windows apps that work on the web, iOS and Android, too.",4/2/2014 0:00,0.480293,27,1,3,4.678799,7,Social Media,245,5115.389,3710.11,66277.78,0.473684,0.182066,0.059145,0.013649,0.7,-0.4,2200

Whether you're a longtime USMNT supporter or a casual soccer fan just getting World Cup fever, here's what you need to know.

[seealso url = ""http://mashable.com/2014/03/30/world-cup-usmnt-mls-players""]

The World Cup's not until June. What is this?

If you're new to the game of soccer, a ""friendly"" is a match that doesn't count on either team's record. Teams play them all the time to try out prospective players or just get in some practice.

This is the USMNT's final friendly before World Cup training camp begins, but the American team will play three more just before leaving for Brazil in June. Those matches should feature essentially the final USMNT roster, as manager Jurgen Klinsmann has until June 2 to submit his final 23-man list of players.

This match, meanwhile, features a roster made up almost entirely of American players who play professionally in the United States or Mexico (many others play for European clubs). For some, it will be a key chance to impress Klinsmann one more time and hopefully earn an invite to training camp. For others guaranteed a World Cup spot, it's an important opportunity to build chemistry with teammates.

So this game may not count, but it definitely matters. ESPN's broadcast starts at 11 p.m. ET.

What to watch for

We'll be treated to a preview of three of the USMNT's more important players: Michael Bradley, Clint Dempsey and Landon Donovan. Watch how they read one another and see if they can do some damage together on the attack and in the midfield. If the USMNT is to make some noise in Brazil this summer, it will need all three MLS stalwarts to create scoring chances and control the ball against top-notch competition.

Beyond those three stars, Wednesday is also an excellent chance to get a look at some lesser American lights who could nonetheless contribute significantly in Brazil. Among the names to keep an eye on: midfielder Graham Zusi and defender Matt Besler of Sporting Kansas City in MLS, midfielder Maurice Edu of the Philadelphia Union, Los Angeles Galaxy defender Omar Gonzalez and DC United striker Eddie Johnson.

It's likely that half the USMNT roster will ultimately be made up of MLS players You can read more about the other candidates here. Meanwhile, here's the USMNT's official 2013 highlight video, if you're looking to get pumped up.

What's the deal with this Julian Green kid?

The short answer: No one really knows, but we should know more after Wednesday.

The longer answer, if you're just catching up: Green is an 18-year-old German-American forward who was born in Tampa but lived almost his entire life in Germany. He plays for Bayern Munich, the world's top club team, but had the option of playing internationally for either the United States or Germany, which has one of the best national teams in the world.

In March, Green committed(Opens in a new window) his international future the United States. This is seen as a potentially huge deal for American soccer, as many feel a player with his combination of youth and potential has never before chosen to suit up for the United States over another country.

But is getting Green a move that could simply pay longterm dividends, or might he actually help this summer? No one knows for sure, and some skeptics fear adding him to the final 23-man World Cup roster over a player who's been grinding away for this opportunity for years could disrupt the team's chemistry. Then again, if Green can really add something, it'd be stupid to leave him home.

Whatever the future holds, Green is all but assured to play against Mexico on Wednesday, giving many USMNT fans their first real look at him in action.

The Mexican club that wouldn't

DaMarcus Beasley and Michael Orozco are both Americans who play for Puebla F.C. in Mexico's Liga MX. They're both players who Klinsmann called up for Wednesday's friendly. And they're both players Puebla would not release for the match.

This didn't make Klinsmann happy, and he took to Twitter (among other places) to vent.

Very disappointed that @PueblaFC(Opens in a new window) did not release DaMarcus Beasley & Michael Orozco. Not in the spirit of this great rivalry!

â€” JÃ¼rgen Klinsmann (@J_Klinsmann) March 31, 2014(Opens in a new window)

So what the hell is going on here? Puebla is not legally obligated to release Beasley and Orozco, since Wednesday's match doesn't fall on one of the official international match dates laid out by FIFA (world soccer's governing body).

Klinsmann purposely did not call up other American players who play for clubs that have important matches of their own this week. Puebla, however, doesn't play again until Saturday. Puebla, in fact, is doing so poorly this season that it's in danger of being demoted to a lesser Mexican division; trying to avoid that relegation is its best rationalization for keeping the two Americans home.

More than likely, however, there's a bit of partisan gamesmanship at play here from the Mexican club. Just because this thing is called a ""friendly"" doesn't mean it's that friendly, after all.

A first look at the USMNT's new look

The USMNT unveiled its new away kits (that means uniforms, for you soccer n00bs) on Tuesday, and will wear them for the first time on Wednesday against Mexico. (They'll wear them in Brazil, too, along with these previously unveiled home numbers(Opens in a new window).) Here's what the brand-new away kits look like, as modeled by Clint Dempsey:

Many online were quick to dismiss the jerseys as looking vaguely Russian, or resembling a classic brand of popsicle(Opens in a new window). We don't think they look so bad at all, but are curious to see them on the field Wednesday.

Now back to that World Cup we mentioned ...

This match is important in many ways, but don't take any positive or negatives from it too seriously. Coming from their regular professional clubs, this batch of USMNT players won't have practiced together much before kickoff, and that will likely show a bit. Similarly, there are many big names -- Jozy Altidore and Tim Howard, for example -- not playing so Klinsmann can get a better look at others based closer to home. And the Mexican squad won't be at full-strength either.

All that being said, it's definitely worth keeping an eye on what's ahead for both countries.

The United States finished first in the two countries' shared regional qualifying group, while Mexico surprisingly needed a playoff win over New Zealand to reach the World Cup. But the United States was unfortunate to get a tougher draw when pool-play foursomes were decided, landing alongside Germany, Portugal and Ghana in Group G. Mexico, meanwhile, landed in a Group A with host country Brazil, Croatia and Cameroon.

The USMNT's Group G is already being called this year's ""Group of Death,"" but Mexico's draw is no cakewalk either. Suffice to say, both sides could use all the practice they can get before the World Cup starts June 12 -- practice that begins Wednesday night against one another.",4/2/2014 0:00,0.646853,9,1,0,4.931507,6,00000,0,4847.328,2532.382,23800,0.383672,0.063048,0.023973,0.020548,0,0,1100
6921623,Venezuela's War of Rhetoric Lands on 'New York Times' Op-Ed Page,"As protests continue in Venezuela, the war of words between the government and its opposition rages on, now in The New York Times opinion pages, revealing the depth of the rift between the two sides.

The paper on Tuesday published an op-ed by Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro calling for ""peace and dialogue.""(Opens in a new window) A week earlier, one of Venezuela's main opposition leaders, Leopoldo Lopez, wrote his own editorial(Opens in a new window) from prison, also published in the Times, denouncing the country as a ""failing state.""

SEE ALSO: Colombian Press Sends 52 Tons of Newsprint to Venezuelan Newspapers

The dueling op-eds, of course, each stick to a narrative that ignores the complaints of their opponent. Maduro focuses on a narrative of class warfare that calls for peaceful dialogue, without mentioning that his government has jailed some of the opposition. Lopez criticizes the current government without acknowledging any of its merits. Both call for dialogue, but appear to put forth incompatible rhetoric.

Maduro posits that the state of Venezuela is not as bad as it appears: poverty has been greatly reduced, there's free healthcare and education, and a democracy of which ""Venezuelans are proud."" He reminds readers that, in 2012, former U.S. President Jimmy Carter proclaimed(Opens in a new window) the nation's electoral system ""the best in the world.""

Lopez, on the other hand, writes that Venezuela is plagued by an ""oppressive political climate,"" a ""crippled economy,"" and the ""governmentâ€™s criminalization of dissent."" He adds, ""I am struck by how much Venezuelans have suffered.""

The president has his own accusations to levy at the opposition: ""The protesters have a single goal: the unconstitutional ouster of the democratically elected government,"" writes Maduro. He accuses opposition leaders of fomenting chaos in the streets and supporting a takeover like the coup aimed at former President Hugo Chavez in 2002.

Lopez, however, writes that the opposition's demands are not so sinister: they consist of the resignation of those responsible for ""repression, abuse and torture,"" freedom for ""political prisoners and dissenters,"" and ""investigation into fraud committed through our commission for currency exchange,"" which Lopez says is at the root of the crippling inflation rate.

And though Lopez issues a call to action that says Venezuelans ""must continue to speak, act and protest,"" he stresses restraint: ""A change in leadership can be accomplished entirely within a constitutional and legal framework.""

Maduro, for his part, stops short of calling protesters ""fascists,"" as he has in the past, but he writes that they are part of the ""wealthier segments of society,"" painting the conflict as a class war in which the U.S. government is on the wrong side.

""It is on the side of the 1% who wish to drag our country back to when the 99% were shut out of political life and only the few â€” including American companies â€” benefited from Venezuelaâ€™s oil,"" he writes.

But the reality in Venezuela seems more complicated than a ""rich versus poor"" narrative can explain. Lower-income citizens have not joined the protests in large numbers, The New York Times(Opens in a new window) has reported, but that doesn't necessarily mean there is monolithic agreement among the poor. And some from poor neighborhoods across the country have indeed taken to the streets, as The Guardian reports(Opens in a new window).

Maduro finally calls for ""dialogue and diplomacy,"" stressing that his government has reached out to the opposition by starting mediated talks with it. But he doesn't mention the fact that his government has also used a heavy hand against at least some of the opposition, including sending elected leaders to jail.

Lopez was imprisoned and charged with arson and conspiracy, though he was previously also accused of murder and terrorism, for allegedly inciting the Feb. 12 protests in Caracas, which ended with three people dead -- allegedly shot by uniformed officers from the Bolivarian National Intelligence Service (SEBIN). ""To this day, no evidence of any kind has been presented,"" Lopez writes.

Another opposition leader, Maria Corina Machado, has been stripped of her seat in Congress and the government intends to jail her for treason. Two opposition mayors have also been arrested and sentenced to prison.

Maduro and Lopez also differed in their assessment of the violence that has resulted from the protests. Lopez initially wrote that the over 30 fatalities were protesters, a correction at the bottom of his op-ed notes, while the reality is that some police have been killed. Maduro, for his part, said protesters were responsible for causing ""about half of the fatalities.""

George Cicariello-Maher, a political science assistant professor at Drexel University, and author of We Created ChÃ¡vez: A Peopleâ€™s History of the Venezuelan Revolution(Opens in a new window), notes that the opposition has effectively used Twitter to spread its message and narrative -- the hashtag #SOSVenezuela, which has been trending at times during the past few weeks, was also widely used in the first few days of the protests to share updates and images.

Maduro's op-ed, therefore, is an attempt at countering the ""existing narrative"" on Venezuela, and an ""attempt to shift public opinion internationally,"" Cicariello-Maher says.

In its own editorial on March 14, before either Maduro's or Lopez's op-eds were published, The New York Times editorial board(Opens in a new window) suggested the two sides of the Venezuelan crisis are playing a ""blame game.""

""This is a bitterly divided population in urgent need of mediated dialogue,"" the Times editorial board wrote.

Itâ€™s clear that viral videos arenâ€™t just low-quality, fan-made shots or off-the-cuff scenes from everyday life. Brands are now fully immersed in the viral video world. Ads continue to move from print and broadcast to digital and mobile, and we are seeing them everywhere.

SEE ALSO: 5 Best Practices for Creating Viral Branded Videos

Brands are now looking to connect with their audiences in a way that not only provides enjoyment to the viewer, but also aligns with the qualities that companies want to embody -- what were once brick-and-mortar businesses are now becoming adroit visual storytellers. Many industry experts consider video to be marketing's new frontier, be it through YouTube or short stories on Instagram, Vine and Snapchat. But creating a successful video is more of an art than a science.

Branded videos spread like wildfire for the same reason non-branded videos go viral: They're compelling and shareable. And making something that a consumer wants to share -- particularly for entertainment value -- is critical for success. Videos should prompt people to engage with a brand in a genuine fashion -- ultimately, people share viral videos (branded or not) because they've stumbled across something they think is worth spreading the word about, regardless of a brand's ulterior motives. Therein lies the magic: The more views and shares your video receives, the more people you reach, and the more an audience becomes aware of your brand and -- potentially -- what you stand for.

Why are they effective?

A YouTube video lets brands be more experimental and risky than a TV, print or sidebar ad -- just check out Virgin Americaâ€™s daring ad from last year, which is actually a flight safety video.

Brands can use music and clever techniques to produce something more provocative, more heartbreaking, more electrifying -- name an emotion, and video can evoke it. If a picture's worth a thousand words, then a video's worth thousands more.

Branded videos can also be as long as necessary, as opposed to a standard 30- or 60-second TV spot. (Still, some particularly catchy or touching(Opens in a new window) TV ads go viral of their own accord once posted online.)

SEE ALSO: The Art of the Branded Video

The skyâ€™s the limit in terms of how a brand makes a video memorable. Many bank on humor, and others, heart. Most videos align themselves with positive messages (Feminism! Power! Quality! Organic goodness!) rather than contesting negative ones. Some do both.

In September 2013, Chipotle released a short film entitled â€œThe Scarecrow.â€ Its emotionally appealing combination of sad, stop-motion critters and a dynamic message that tugged at our heartstrings feels like a kid-friendly Pixar short. The brand recruited Fiona Apple to sing a haunting rendition of â€œPure Imagination,â€ knowingly tapping into her personal fanbase. Above all, the video re-aligns the company with a message Chipotle has long been promoting -- â€œFood with Integrity.â€

At more than three minutes, â€œThe Scarecrowâ€ is longer than most viral videos. But the poignant mini-film is so powerful that itâ€™s not only shareable, but also almost -- almost -- makes us forget about the brand's fake Twitter-hacking fiasco just a few months prior. If Chipotle released the video to counter its PR debacle, it worked.

People aren't fooled -- they know Chipotle is a money-making corporation -- but they've become fans of the brand because it stands for something greater than simply chicken burritos.

Brand visibility and timing

Some of the most outstanding content that brands are publishing trends toward lightly (rather than overtly) branded videos -- instead of focusing on self-promotion, brands ensure their videos have appeal; the promotion and brand affinity comes later. Consider that most ads only reveal their brand affiliation at the end, rather than pulsing the brand throughout. Sometimes viewers might not even realize they're watching a branded video until the final frame -- and if viewers make it to the end, like what they see and, upon seeing the brand's name, are pleasantly surprised -- thatâ€™s a win.

When it comes to launch style, there's a spectrum of options. Some videos, such as Red Bullâ€™s 2012 supersonic freefall by Felix Baumgartner, are hyped up through social media far in advance. (In this particular case, this method makes sense, as the brand was looking to break a world record and garner support and attention.) At the other end of the spectrum, some brands release a video online without disclosing who or what produced it or the brandâ€™s intent. A recent example is clothing company WREN's(Opens in a new window) video â€œFirst Kiss,â€ which many viewers initially believed to be a short film. There's also the approach of the follow-up ""making-of"" video, as Kuka Robotics(Opens in a new window) experimented with after releasing â€œThe Duel: Timo Boll vs. KUKA Robot.""

Perhaps the most popular examples of ""brand withholding"" are the prank videos from Jimmy Kimmel, such as the recent â€œWorst Twerk Fail Everâ€ and â€œEpic #SochiFail: Wolf in my hall.â€ These types of buzzworthy videos get everyone talking and promote Kimmel's personal brand -- and he (mostly) gets away with it due to the nature of his profession. (Though there has been some backlash.)

This approach can be risky for branded content -- if a brand doesnâ€™t immediately disclose that itâ€™s behind a viral video, people may feel as if the company was disingenuous, or even feel resentful for being tricked into thinking something was real when it was actually staged. Knowing the risks, itâ€™s up to the brand to predict how viewers will respond.

All-in-all, there are a number of strategies brands can employ when it comes to approaching branded viral videos. Yes, shelling out to make a video can be time-consuming and quite costly, but thatâ€™s not always the case -- HelloFlo's(Opens in a new window) Camp Gyno video was created for just $6,000.

Short- and long-term implications

Thereâ€™s always the chance that even after all those dollars and hours spent on production, a video will flop. Or maybe it'll go ""viral,"" but those hits won't translate to financial success or retail performance. But visual storytelling can help your organization stay relevant in ways that cannot be measured, and the trend doesn't seem to be going anywhere soon.

Putin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov confirmed the news(Opens in a new window) to Russian news agency Itar Tass on Tuesday, months after the couple said they would divorce in a surprise television announcement(Opens in a new window) last June. The Putins have two daughters, Yekaterina and Maria, both in their late 20s.

However, site visitors can still find her name on a page(Opens in a new window) dedicated to a lengthier version of the president's life story.

Although little is known about Putin's private affairs, rumors that the marriage was on shaky ground have been around since 2008. That year, Russian newspaper Moskovsky Korrespondent published an article(Opens in a new window) alleging that the president planned to marry former Olympic gymnast Alina Kabayeva.

6786564,Everything That's New in the Windows 8.1 Update,"Windows 8 critics, this is it. The Windows 8.1 Update was made to fix everything you think is wrong with Microsoft's touch-friendly version of Windows.

That probably won't stop the complaints, but with this update, the new touch- and tile-centric Windows finally feels right on ""traditional"" mouse-and-keyboard setups, mainly laptops. Individually, the new features are fairly minor, but overall they represent a power shift for those machines -- a reassertion of the desktop.

[seealso slug=""dual-boot-windows-8""]

In Windows 8 and later 8.1, the desktop felt more or less like ""just another app"" among the array of live tiles on the Start screen. Even if you spent the majority of your time with desktop apps, it seemed that Windows was trying to throw you back to the modern environment (aka ""Metro"") every chance it got. Opening a simple photo, for instance, launched the Modern Photos, not a desktop app.

Now things are different. Post-Windows 8.1 Update, the desktop is felt throughout the experience on a laptop or ""traditional"" PC. (Touch-first devices, such as the Surface 2 and Surface Pro 2, get some of the updates, but the desktop stays in the background.) The effect is often subtle, but sometimes it's a godsend.

""We recognize that for a certain group of people -- namely people who use a mouse and keyboard -- we could have done a better job of building a bridge from where those people are currently to what we built inside of Windows,"" Christopher Flores, Microsoft's director of Windows client communications, told Mashable. ""[The Update] is a collection of minor updates that we've done to complete the overall experience.""

Anyone with Windows 8.1 will get the update on April 8. There's no manual download required -- it'll happen automatically. Here's an overview of the most important changes.

Boot to Desktop Default

Windows 8.1 introduced the option to boot to desktop, but you had to hunt it down in a settings menu to engage it. Now your PC will boot to the desktop automatically. You can always change it back, of course.

Modern Apps in the Taskbar

Credit: Microsoft

The taskbar -- the little ribbon that runs along the bottom of the screen in the desktop -- somehow got a bad rap in the initial rollout of Windows 8. Modern apps didn't show up there, and even the Start button didn't want to be a part of it.

In Windows 8.1, the Start button made a dramatic return to the taskbar, and in the 8.1 Update, the apps follow. You can now pin Modern apps to the taskbar, switching between them without ever going to Start or using the left-side app drawer. The taskbar will even appear in any Modern app if you push down on the bottom of the screen.

To get users started pinning Modern apps, the update pins the Windows Store to the taskbar by default. ""When you pin the Store by default to one of the most UIs in Windows, people start clicking on it,"" says Microsoft's Chaitanya Sareen, who led the visual design team for Windows 8 and 8.1. ""There's a good chunk of people who aren't familiar with [Windows] apps. Putting that front and center has increased engagement.""

Title Bars

As a kind of companion to the taskbar, a title bar drops down from the top of the screen when you launch a Modern app, then goes away after a few seconds. These are actually not new -- they're actually borrowed from the Windows desktop apps' full-screen modes, probably most used with Internet Explorer. Moving the mouse pointer to the top of the screen brings the header back anytime, and it includes icons for closing and minimizing.

""This is the Windows DNA,"" Sareen says. ""People see the familiar controls -- minimize, close -- and we were very pleasantly surprised that in our usability study we had 100% success of people getting out of a Modern app.""

Desktop Apps Are Default

One of the more frustrating things about Windows 8/8.1 has been it favoring of the Modern UI at inappropriate times. If you, say, double-clicked on a video file, it would instantly launch the Modern version of Windows Media Player, thrusting you into the full-screen experience even though you probably didn't want or expect that to happen.

The 8.1 Update does the more sensible thing and by default will launch the desktop versions of those apps when you click. It's a subtle change that really makes a huge difference for ease of use. Of course, you can alter the defaults if you wish.

""The feedback we got is 'I like [Modern] apps, but I like to go there on my own terms,'"" says Sareen.

Search and Shutdown Icons

Credit: Microsoft

Even though you can search just by typing from the Start screen, that's not immediately obvious to new users. So the 8.1 Update adds a search icon to the top right of the Start screen to bestow a visual clue. Likewise, there's an icon for shutting down the machine, which was previously a swipe away. A little redundancy never hurt anybody.

Sareen explains: ""There are some people who totally got on that train and can just type and they trust the machine. Others need that cue. So we just added that cue back.""

Little Things

The 8.1 Update includes a few other tweaks. When you search, Windows Store apps will show up in the results, which gives developers another way users may discover their apps. Live tiles now have proper right-click menus for mouse setups. The ""All Apps"" list has better markers for new apps as well as notifications. The OS disk image is smaller for some machines, freeing up a little more device storage. And Microsoft added back some functionality in Internet Explorer so certain enterprise customers will finally have a web browser with their customized apps.

The Final Fix?

Unlike some of the upgrades in Windows 8.1, the changes in the Windows 8.1 Update are almost universally subtle and minor. So why did Microsoft take so long to implement them?

The company isn't saying officially, but from the pattern, it's easy to discern an admission that Microsoft perhaps went too far in designing a touch-friendly version of Windows. While it was a potentially powerful tablet OS, many of the features weren't really suited for traditional PCs, which the majority of users had at the time.

Now, finally, Microsoft has seen the error of its ways and given back the desktop-centered Windows that power users crave. With the Windows 8.1 Update, the current version of Windows is about as good as it can get. If you've been holding out on upgrading, now's the time.",4/2/2014 0:00,0.514184,16,1,10,4.687603,10,Business,2278.5,7687.901,4273.792,25766.67,0.439392,0.135117,0.057851,0.019835,0.5,0.5,1900
7012933,"Want to Build a Windows Wearable? That'll Be $0, Please","Microsoft has cut the price of Windows to $0 for manufacturers to use on phones, devices with screens smaller than 9 inches, and the ""Internet of Things"" -- products such as smart TVs and wearables.

By making Windows free on those devices, Microsoft will be in a much better position to compete with the likes of Android -- which now dominates the smartphone market, and is rising fast in tablets -- mainly because it costs manufacturers nothing to use. Windows usually requires paying Microsoft a licensing fee.

[seealso slug=""microsoft-2013-milestones""]

For phones, the benefits of the price cut are obvious, although a little late in the game. For smaller-screen devices, it puts Windows tablets in a better position to compete, and may help various companies produce better competitors to the Google Chromebook, which has been a popular choice with schools and other organizations that don't need laptops with lots of computing power.

The Internet of Things is a nascent field, but it's beginning to take shape -- most recently with Google's announcement of the Android Wear operating system for wearables. The Microsoft equivalent will the Windows for the Internet of Things, which the company showed a preview of at its Build Developer Conference.

[seealso slug= ""microsoft-announces-windows-8-1-update/""]

""We believe Windows Phone is the world's most personal smartphone,"" said Microsoft's Corporate Vice President for Windows Phone Joe Belifore.

The latest version of Windows Phone includes Microsoft's long-rumored personal assistant Cortana, which is functionally similar to the iPhone's Siri.

Belifore said the Bing-powered Cortana, is launching in the US in beta, was inspired by real-world personal assistants. Cortana can schedule appointments, set alarms and find nearby restaurants. It can also send contextual reminders-- reminding you to ask your sister about her new puppy the next time you talk to her, for example.

The assistant also supports searches for content stored locally on your device and works with third-party apps like Hulu and Facebook.

The 8.1 update also includes a new action center that displays stats like Facebook notifications and battery information and a refreshed start screen.

Windows Phone Store has also been refreshed with new categories, quick links, and larger tiles to make it easier to find apps.

Belifore also demoed a new Wi-Fi Sense app. The app learns about nearby wifi networks and automatically connects you to local hotspots. The service also provides a way to share wifi networks with others without revealing a password.

Skype is also integrated in new ways in the 8.1 update. Users can now switch directly to a Skype voice or video call from within phone calls.

Microsoft has also revamped the keyboard in Windows Phone 8.1. The new ""wordflow"" keyboard supports gesture-based typing, similar to those found on Android. Belifore said the new keyboard is the fastest smartphone keyboard available and, in fact, holds the new world record for fastest smartphone typing.

Belifore said the update will be rolling out to existing Windows Phone users in the ""next few months"" and will ship on new devices beginning in late April and early May.

7012762,Artist Turns Your Brainwaves Into 3D-Printed Sculptures,"I'm sitting in artist Ion Popian's light-filled Long Island City, N.Y., studio, with a NeuroSky(Opens in a new window) electroencephalogram (EEG) sensor pressing against my temple and forehead. I watch a TV screen, where abstract shapes ripple and mutate in crisp 4K resolution.

Behind me, a computer measures my brain activity, mapping it as a 3D model. This model initially looks like a piece of paper, a flat plane. When my brainwaves register concentration in response to the film, a dimple appears in the plane; when they register calm, the surface pushes upward into a peak. ""We can't map specific emotions: anger or sadness or happiness,"" Popian explains. ""Instead, we're mapping intensities.""

[seealso slug=""space-twitter-accounts""]

This exercise is the first phase in Popian's Mental Fabrications(Opens in a new window), an art project that turns these brain maps into three-dimensional objects. Editing the map in a 3D modeling program, Popian and programmer Thomas Martinez(Opens in a new window) convert the raw data into a smooth, undulating landscape that is then 3D-printed -- creating, essentially, a tangible model of your mind you could theoretically display in your apartment. Itâ€™s your brain on tech.

Popian debuted the concept at SoHo's HarvestWorks(Opens in a new window) gallery. There he showed the film, produced by filmmaker Noah Schulman(Opens in a new window), to wired-up attendees, and the results were projected on a gallery wall. There's something strangely intimate about watching a stranger's brainwaves spike and dip with every passing thought, and yet, as Popian points out, it's not really voyeurism -- the thoughts themselves are still inscrutable.

""The exhibit becomes a symbiotic relationship between the person who comes to the exhibit who creates the artwork"" -- the brain scans themselves -- ""and me, creating the system by which they can do that,"" he says.

As the next phase in the project, Popian plans to turn those models into something still more three-dimensional, by morphing them into free-standing figures rather than rolling planes. One such sculpture, on view at the HarvestWorks exhibit, is a curvaceous mass that turns in on itself, almost reflectively, like an abstracted version of Rodin's ""The Thinker.""

Popian's background is architecture, and while he approaches Mental Fabrications as art, he sees the tech behind it as having far-reaching applications for his trade. He's even transformed the mental maps into architectural renderings, as a conceptual exercise.

In architecture, emotion doesn't typically factor into how a structure is designed, he says. And yet, ""architecture has a visual impact on whoever occupies it, which produces emotion."" EEG technology could therefore affect how buildings are designed in the future, he says. ""If we start mapping out the subconscious relationships of people while they experience a space -- for example, an airport or a hospital -- we can start designing architecture that is responsive to them.""

Of course, the tech needs to evolve first. The sort of basic EEG mapping the NeuroSky performs is mostly used for gaming, and by the occasional Quantified Self enthusiast.

Behind the Scenes. Mental Fabrications Project(Opens in a new window) from Ion Popian(Opens in a new window) on Vimeo(Opens in a new window).

As data, these sculptures don't say much. Sometimes your brain radiates calm, sometimes concentration. Popian theorizes concentration spikes when your conscious mind is active, while meditation takes over when you recede into your subconscious. But as an art project, it doesn't much matter. The data doesn't need to work hard to be impressive. Mental Fabrications reminds us that even cold, hard data can be sacred and moving. In this context, itâ€™s enough to marry two novel technologies, and admire the strange topographies theyâ€™ve produced.",4/3/2014 0:00,0.564103,15,12,1,4.796178,6,00000,0,6039.121,2600.518,2721,0.454545,0.077273,0.031847,0.012739,0.25,0.25,2700

7005746,This Is What the UK Looks Like Today,"An unhealthy mix of dust particles from the Sahara Desert along with pollution from the big cities in Western Europe has cut visibilities across the UK this week. In addition, light surface winds have let the toxic soup of ingredients in place, rather than sweeping them out to sea.

The worst of the pollution has been across southeast England, including London, where air quality has deteriorated to level 10 on the 10-point scale - the worst-possible reading. Levels are determined by the amount of five pollutants in the air -- ozone, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and two types of particulate matter. Such hazardous air quality levels can be harmful to those with compromised immune systems, respiratory ailments including asthma, and the young and elderly, and the UK typically only experiences levels this high about five times a year.

According to BBC News(Opens in a new window), the London Ambulance Service reported a 14% increase on Wednesday in emergency calls related to breathing difficulties. The BBC quoted British Prime Minister David Cameron as saying the atmosphere has been ""unpleasant.""

""I didn't go for my morning run this morning; I chose to do some work instead, but you can feel it,"" Cameron said.

As Mashable reported Wednesday, a large dust storm in the Sahara Desert vaulted dust to high altitudes, where it was picked up by strong winds and carried all the way to the UK.

7041291,Amazon Fire TV's 8 Stiffest Competitors,"Amazon is coming to a TV near you.

The company introduced Fire TV on Wednesday, a voice-activated set-top box device that comes with a remote control, gaming controller and connects to the Internet. It's the company's latest endeavor in the television world (following its popular instant streaming service and foray into scripted programs, such as Alpha House(Opens in a new window)).

7032436,What Does Amazon's Fire TV Mean for Gaming?,"Amazon's announcement of a set-top box Wednesday morning came to no surprise to anyone following the space. The inclusion of gaming elements was also not a surprise; leaked images of its controller appeared online a month ago and were spot on to what the company showed off at Fire TV unveiling.

Gaming may not have been the forefront of the presentation or press materials, but its hard to ignore the message it sends. Between next-generation consoles like the Xbox One and PlayStation 4, Nintendo's more family-focused Wii U, the upcoming Valve Steam machines that bring PC gaming to the TV, Android-based gaming consoles like the OUYA, there's no shortage of ways to get games and other content on your TV in one place.

Amazon may have the power to get wide adoption for the Fire TV, but will it solve any problems for gaming, or add another piece of hardware to a very crowded marketplace?

Android Console Mania

Let's flash back two summers ago, to the Kickstarter campaign for the OUYA. The $99, Android-based gaming console raised $2.6 million on the first day of funding based on the promise of opening mobile gaming to the television. Others joined in the marketplace: the GameStick, the GamePop, and other controllers that promised to bring your Android games to the TV.

The OUYA is really the only remaining game in town from that lot, and it has even pivoted from its original business model in the way games are sold in its marketplace. Both it and the Amazon Fire TV have the same starting price point -- $99 -- though you'll need to plunk down another $40 get Amazon's game controller. Games on both aren't expensive either; many OUYA games are still ""free-to-try"" and Amazon touted most of its titles will cost around $1.84.

So are OUYA's creators scared?

""Just as Amazon blazed a trail for a new way of selling online, OUYA invented a new way to think about console games. But for us, games are not simply an 'added bonus' -- they're the whole point. OUYA is solely dedicated to the devs creating games, and the players who play them. Their ideal experience is all we think about,"" said OUYA CEO Julie Uhrman in a statement.

Uhrman's point is correct. Amazon needs to make sure to give the Fire TV game store the curation and love it requires. Otherwise it will be a giant headache for users, and won't attract new players. But while the company didn't make a big show of all the talent it had brought in to the gaming space, publishers and developers were very quickly to send out releases about new titles coming to Fire TV. The number is very encouraging, with casual/mobile names like GameLoft, Glu and Jackbox Games creating content alongside AAA publishers like EA, 2K Games and Ubisoft, names normally associated with traditional game consoles.

Gunning for next-gen

For casual gamers ever considering picking up a next-generation gaming console, the decision now may be less clear cut. If you were already on board with purchasing an Xbox One, PlayStation 4 or Wii U, you probably already grabbed at least one of those. All three offer lots of gaming options, but also integration with media apps like like Netflix, Hulu Plus, Amazon Instant Video, YouTube and more.

Consoles like that each come with big exclusive titles that attract gamers; the Xbox One is drawing shooter fans in with Titanfall for example. But if you just play a few games, and if you don't spend a ton on it as a hobby, you might not want to spend $400 to $500 on a new console. Adults who have ""aged out"" of gaming and parents with young kids are perfect examples of this potential demographic.

A major push during the Xbox One marketing campaign was how it integrated into all aspects of entertainment. While the One certainly still does much more, like work with a cable box, Kinect-based fitness apps, Skype and an online friends list, there might be customers who don't want all the extra bells and whistles and will be happy with a snazzy set-top box. (Provided they don't already have an Apple TV, Chromecast or Roku.) Nintendo and Sony may have less to worry from this challenger, since both cater to more specific segments of the gamer population with their consoles.

The hackneyed phrase ""content is king"" never rang more true, though. Android, as a mobile platform, suffers because it doesn't get the best games first. Amazon will have to build a user base developers want to make games for, but also bring games that make people want to buy a controller. With games coming from its own internal studio, which just hired more talent like the designer of seminal puzzle game Portal(Opens in a new window), the company could be on the right track.

7012723,Apple v. Samsung Trial: 5 Things You Need to Know,"They're at it again. Apple and Samsung, two titans of mobile technology, are resolving in a San Jose federal courtroom the issues they can't in the marketplace -- for a second time.

Apple says Samsung infringed on its patents, effectively stealing the key elements of the iPhone for a whole range of subsequent Samsung smartphones, each of which Apple is seeking to remove from the market (and to get punitive damages for). Samsung has purchased a few software patents of its own, and is wielding those against Apple's iOS in a kind of rear-guard action.

Not a great deal has happened yet in the trial, which started -- appropriately enough, some might say -- on April Fools' Day. The only noteworthy incident, so far, was the curious sight of a top Apple executive denying he knew anything about Ellen's Oscar selfie, which happened to be taken on a Samsung phone.

Still, you might have a few questions about this courtroom drama, and it's worth getting up to speed on them now, albeit as briefly as possible.

1. Didn't we just see this movie?

In 2012, Apple won a very similar case against Samsung in this exact same courtroom. The jury awarded Apple $1 billion in damages, which the judge later knocked down by a mere $70 million; that case is on appeal. Samsung has not paid anything yet, despite hilarious Internet rumors that the Korean company paid Apple entirely in nickels(Opens in a new window).

2. So, why are we seeing the sequel?

The main difference in Apple v. Samsung redux is that it accuses a new generation of Samsung smartphones and phablets, such as the Galaxy Note 2 and the Galaxy Tab 2. Oh, and Samsung didn't have those patents it claims Apple is infringing last time around. In court, Apple is accusing its rival of patent shopping with malicious intent.

Other than that, both sides seem to be gearing up for almost identical arguments to the last trial. So far, Apple is sticking to what worked last time around: an emotional appeal to the necessity to protect innovation, a stirring narrative about how hard the iPhone was to develop.

Samsung's lawyers may use some more fancy footwork this time, but their basic argument hasn't changed: to punish rival smartphones at this fundamental a level -- because theirs happen to have the same kinds of curves at its corners, for example -- is to stifle competition. Apple's five patents at issue here are effectively invalid, Samsung says.

3. This is really a proxy battle for iOS vs. Android, right?

That depends on your point of view. Apple says no; it's just about basic patent infringement and the need to protect creative risk-taking. Samsung says yes, because the more it can frame Apple as obsessively anti-Google and anti-Android, the more Samsung looks like an innocent bystander caught in the crossfire of Silicon Valley giants.

To this end, Samsung has already pulled out of its sleeve an email in which Steve Jobs declared ""holy war"" against Android a priority for Apple. This is not far from the ""thermonuclear war"" Jobs threatened to wage on a mobile operating system he considered a blatant theft of Apple's property. Jobs' choice of words, however, may not matter compared to the impossibility of getting a jury in Silicon Valley that doesn't automatically venerate the local kid.

4. What's the endgame here?

We're looking at weeks -- possibly months even -- of arguments before Judge Lucy Koh, who is known for her tough manner and colorful turns of phrase. (She jokingly accused Apple lawyers of ""smoking crack"" Tuesday because they were overly optimistic about how fast the trial would proceed.) Then a jury will decide the winner -- if there is to be any.

Apple is seeking damages of $2 billion this time around, plus banning the offending Samsung phones from sale in the U.S. That latter part didn't fly the last time around, and given how many of the phones in question have already been retired anyway, it's kind of a losing battle to begin with. Smartphone cycles are faster than the law and always will be. More likely, Apple is using this as a test case to see if it can fire a warning shot at Android smartphone manufacturers, force some design changes and claw back some iPhone market share in the interim.

Samsung, on the other hand, is asking for a mere $7 million in damages for the infringement of its patents. Or, as Tim Cook could call it, walking-around money for Apple.

5. What was that about the Apple executive and Ellen?

In court on Tuesday, Samsung attorney Bill Price questioned Phil Schiller, Apple's VP of marketing. Price was trying to grill Schiller about those patents Samsung says Apple infringed, which happen to be photo and video patents, and asked whether the iPhone could take a selfie ""like Ellen DeGeneres did during the Oscars.""

That selfie heard round the world was rather shamelessly associated with the Samsung phone on which it was taken. Schiller may have sensed a trap.

7024570,The Cause of Earth's Largest Mass Extinction: Microbe Sex,"Around 252 million years ago, 90 percent of all species on Earth were wiped out in an extinction event commonly called The Great Dying. Now, a team of MIT researchers from the U.S. and China might have the answer for the largest mass extinction our planet has ever seen.

It wasnâ€™t asteroids or volcanoes, but methane-producing microbes called Methanosarcina having sex -- or rather, passing genetic material in a strange microbial form of sex.

SEE ALSO: NASA Discovers New Evidence to Suggest Water On Mars

Scientists believe that these microbes acquired a set of genes that allowed them to feed off the rich organic carbon deposits that have developed in the oceans. In doing so, the microbes spewed â€œprodigious amountsâ€ of methane into the atmosphere, dramatically changing the climate and chemistry of the oceans -- literally suffocating almost all other life forms on the planet.

The researchersâ€™ case against the potential culprit(Opens in a new window) Methanosarcina rests on three pieces of evidence. There was an exponential increase in carbon dioxide in the oceans at the time; genetic evidence for a change in Methanosarcina to make it produce methane; and sediments showing an increased amount of nickel deposits.

Previously, scientists attributed the increase in carbon dioxide and methane to volcanic eruptions. But calculations by the MIT team proved that the volcanic activity at the time couldnâ€™t have produced enough to account for the carbon in the sediments. Similarly, the way in which volcanoes produce gas -- rapidly at first, followed by a steady decrease -- couldnâ€™t account for the steady increase in carbon dioxide.

â€œThat suggests a microbial expansion,â€ Gregory Fournier, a MIT postdoc and researcher on the team, said in a statement(Opens in a new window). â€œThe growth of microbial populations is among the few phenomena capable of increasing carbon production exponentially, or even faster.""

The team tested 50 different genomes(Opens in a new window) of methane-producing bacteria, and discovered that they acquired the ability to â€œeatâ€ organic carbon around 252 million years ago.

The researchers believe that Methanosarcina acquired this ability -- and in the process, produced extreme levels of methane -- through gene transfer, aka sex, with a different microbe. The Methanosarcina needed the right nutrient to proliferate so quickly -- namely nickel.

6423248,Cassini Finds Evidence of a Hidden Ocean on Saturn's Moon,"Finding liquid water on a celestial body within the solar system is exciting. The only thing that is probably more exciting is finding an ocean full of it. Today such news comes via Cassini, which has made measurements that show that Saturn's moon Enceladus has a hidden ocean beneath its icy surface.

While orbiting Saturn in 2005, Cassini found jets of salty water spewing from the south polar region of Enceladus. According to Luciano Iess of Sapienza University of Rome, lead author of the new study published in Science(Opens in a new window), ""The discovery of the jets was unexpected.""

Geysers require liquid water, and we wouldn't expect Enceladus to have any. It is too far from the Sun to absorb much energy and too small (just 500km in diameter) to have trapped enough internal energy to keep its core molten. The answer to how the water got there might lie in the details of the moon's internal structure.

Water beneath an icy crust

The data to understand Enceladus's internal structure came from by measuring changes in Cassini's speed as it flew close to the moon. When passing the denser parts of the moon, it sped up by a few extra thousandths of a meter per second. That minute change was tracked through recordings of the radio signals Cassini was sending to NASA's Deep Space Network station.

In making such tiny measurements, scientists had to filter out other factors that could influence Cassini's speed. These include pressure on the spacecraft from sunlight, the nudge from heat radiating from its nuclear-powered electrical generator, and the drag of the particles it strikes as it passes through the south polar plumes.

Iess and his colleagues have produced a model of the internal structure of Enceladus using the measurements. They conclude that there is a core that is roughly 200km in diameter; above that lies a 10km-thick layer of liquid water, which is followed by 40km of ice crust. The water layer may extend all the way to the north pole, but its thickest part lies at the south pole.

This diagram illustrates the possible interior of Saturn's moon Enceladus based on a gravity investigation by NASA's Cassini spacecraft and NASA's Deep Space Network, reported in April 2014. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech

It is possible that Saturn's powerful gravity is responsible for the liquid water under Enceladus's surface. Its pull could heat up the interior through a process called tidal kneading, which involves the slow compression and expansion of the core as the moon rotates through Saturn's gravity well.

After the initial discovery of the plumes, Cassini's minders put a lot of effort into determining Enceladus's internal structure, but it still took nearly ten years to do so. This is because the time the spacecraft spends around Saturn is very valuable, and there are lots of other things worth studying.

Cassini can only make a handful of flybys near Enceladus while still paying attention to other moons, such as Titan. When approaching Enceladus, the controllers also had to make a choice about how to study the moon because of a limitation in how Cassini's instruments are arranged. When making gravitational recordings it needs to point its antenna towards Earth, but in doing so all its other instruments face away from Enceladus. Of the 19 flybys, only three were used to make gravitational recordings.

""After spending eight years in the Saturnian system, one may think that the measurements are becoming repetitive and that Cassini has discovered everything in the reach of its instruments. This is far from being true,"" Iess said.

Time is running out

""The evidence adds up to a large and active body of water under Enceladus's southern polar region"", Helen Maynard-Casely of Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation said. But she warned, ""It is going to be a long time before we can verify if this ocean is there, if ever.""

The plutonium-powered spacecraft has enough energy to power itself till 2017. The trouble is that, in three years, it will only be able to make three more flybys of Enceladus, which is not enough to take more gravity data. Its end is slated to come when controllers drive it into Saturn's atmosphere for incineration, because scientists are keen to avoid having it crash into Saturn's pristine moons.

There is a push to send another mission to Saturn, but Jupiter's moon Europa might be a better candidate to search for life. At 3,100km in diameter, it is much larger than Enceladus, and, in December, astronomers spotted water vapor(Opens in a new window) coming from its south pole, as well.

The possibility of finding a large amount of liquid water is exciting because, for life to exist as we understand it, we need liquid water. Even on Earth, whenever such untouched sources of liquid water, such as Lakes Vostok(Opens in a new window) and Ellsworth(Opens in a new window) under Antarctica, are studied, there is always the hope that we may discover new forms of life.",4/3/2014 0:00,0.549724,9,1,0,5.123626,8,Business,3333.179,5910.902,4143.513,0,0.445399,0.182382,0.049451,0.010989,0,0,959

Unfortunately for MLB player Junior Lake, however, his Thursday fashion foible was broadcast across the nation.

[seealso url = ""http://mashable.com/2014/03/31/expanded-replay-mlb-game""]

Lake somehow donned a different gray road-uniform model than the one all his Chicago Cubs teammates were sporting against the Pittsburgh Pirates.

NBC Sports was quick to point out the blunder on Twitter, turning many fans into amateur fashion critics.

Had this happened to almost any other team in professional sports, viewers may have simply had a quick laugh and moved on. But since the Cubs have not won a World Series since 1908, and are known for a sort of endearing ineptitude, the joke quickly became that the poor Cubbies can't even perform the simplest tasks correctly.

7012505,Chomping Piranha Plants and 4 Other Surprises From 'Mario Kart 8',"Mario Kart returns to the television in May in full, crisp HD glory in Mario Kart 8 on the Wii U, with enough new editions and old staples for fans of the series to drool over.

Mashable got hands on time with Mario Kart 8, and got to see how the improved graphics and new features fit together. Here's what got us most excited:

1. Piranha plants and boomerangs will make other drivers cry

Since playing Mario Kart is all about ruining your friends' perfect run with a well-placed item, it's good to know there are new ways to do that in this game. Nintendo has introduced a biting Piranha Plant, which will attack objects and other players as the driver holds it. Each time it bites, it also produces a small speed boost.

There's also the Boomerang Flower, which gives players three looping shots to stun other drivers in their path.

2. Rainbow Roaaaaaad!

The classic track from Mario Kart 64 that caused so much pain is back in beautiful HD. Mario Kart 8 includes 16 new courses, and 16 remixed classics. Others fans will recognize include ""Toad's Turnpike"", originally in Mario Kart 64 and ""Moo Moo Meadows"" from Mario Kart Wii.

3. Spin, flip and fly with anti-gravity

The anti-gravity elements of Mario Kart 8 have been touted as early as last year's E3, but Nintendo revealed some of their more aggressive angles during the demo. Some ramps in the track give spin boosts, which players can use to collide with others and knock them off their game. On later courses, hover zones can also offer shortcuts and speed boosts to players who know to look for them.

4. Share successes with Mario Kart TV

Mario Kart 8 features full online play for up to 12 players, as well as the local options. If you want to show off your best matches you can share them via Mario Kart TV, which hooks into the Wii U's social network Miiverse.

5. All the classic Mario Kart racers

Nintendo revealed last month that all of Bowser's children -- the eight Koopalings -- are playable characters in Mario Kart 8. Joining them are returning favorites Lakatu, Shy Guy and Metal Mario. Each character has a cadre of cars and bikes to choose from to customize handling, and players can even choose the glider that pops out on aerial sections.

Players can choose from a variety of control options, including the Wii U pro controller, the Wii remote and wheel, or a Wii remote and nunchuck. The Wii U GamePad can also be used for off-TV play.

Mario Kart 8 is out May 30 for Wii U for $59.99.

6867429,When a Family Business Should Look for an Unrelated CEO,"Family businesses that operate in an industry that values cutting-edge innovation would best be served by looking outside the family for company leaders, according to research from Concordia University's John Molson School of Business(Opens in a new window).

While family members make good CEOs of family businesses(Opens in a new window) that are part of a traditional industry built on quality and reputation, such as food producers, service providers or wine makers(Opens in a new window), the study found that in industries that prioritize pushing boundaries over preserving tradition, like the information technology sector, cellular communications or pharmaceuticals, an aggressive attitude in the marketplace is necessary to lead.

""Because family CEOs tend to focus more on family values, while non-family CEOs seek to innovate, that means a CEO from outside the family circle might be a better choice,"" said Peter Jaskiewicz, the study's lead author and associate professor at Concordia.

Jaskiewicz said in traditional industries, it's all about preserving tradition.

""But that doesn't work in newer industries where it's all about constant innovation in rapidly changing environments,"" he said.

In order for family CEOs(Opens in a new window) to succeed in more innovative industries, they need to be held to a standard that's at least as high as the industry average, Jaskiewicz said.

""They also have to make sure the CEOs are competent enough to handle industry pressures and to balance family advice with outsider feedback and industry savvy,"" he said.

While hiring someone from outside the family circle might not go over very well with customers and employees in certain collectivistic cultures, such as those found in Asia, South America and southern Europe, Jaskiewicz doesn't think it would be a big issue in the U.S.

Brown had been recently kicked out of California rehab facility, causing him to violate his probation, which led to his March 14 arrest and subsequent jail time without bail.

7012548,U.S. Reportedly Built 'Cuban Twitter' to Undermine Castro Government,"The U.S. secretly built a Twitter-like service with the aim of stirring political unrest in Cuba, a report by the Associated Press claims.

The ""Cuban Twitter"" project(Opens in a new window), called ""ZunZuneo,"" was publicly launched in 2010; it lasted more than two years, and had tens of thousands of subscribers. The plan was to circumvent Cuba's internet filters, build a young audience and then turn them into dissenters, but the question that now arises is: was the scheme legal?

The AP obtained a 2010 memo from a company called Mobile Accord Inc., which was one of the project's creators.

""There will be absolutely no mention of United States government involvement. This is absolutely crucial for the long-term success of the service and to ensure the success of the Mission,"" the memo said.

The project, which included a companion website and a marketing campaign, cost an estimated $1.6 million; publicly, though, the money was meant to be spent for an unspecified project in Pakistan. ZunZuneo disappeared abruptly in 2012.

To hide the money trail, the company was set up in Spain, with the money flowing from the Cayman Islands, a British offshore tax haven.

According to the AP, officials at the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) would not say who approved the project or whether the Obama administration was aware of it.

The United States' relations with Cuba have improved since RaÃºl Castro succeeded his brother Fidel as president. Notably, in December 2013, President Barack Obama shook hands with Castro at Nelson Mandela's funeral in Johannesburg, South Africa -- the first formal greeting between American and Cuban leaders since 2000.

7012433,David Letterman to Retire From 'Late Show' in 2015,"Late Show host David Letterman, the longest-running late night talk show host, is retiring in 2015 after more than 30 years in the business.

Letterman, 66, will announce the news on Thursday's episode, though the show's YouTube account has already posted a video of the announcement (watch above).

[seealso slug=""jay-leno-tonight-show-finale/""]

""His greatness will always be remembered here, and he will certainly sit among the pantheon of this business,"" Leslie Moonves, president and CEO of CBS Corporation, said in a statement. ""Itâ€™s going to be tough to say goodbye.""

Additionally, R.E.M. bassist Mike Mills broke the news on Twitter. The show's YouTube account shared this clip of Mills discussing his social media scoop:

Letterman's announcement comes just months after his rival Jay Leno tearfully said goodbye to The Tonight Show, solidifying the changing of the guard for late-night hosts, which now include Jimmy Fallon, Jimmy Kimmel, Seth Meyers, Craig Ferguson, John Stewart, Stephen Colbert and Conan O'Brien.

Letterman hosted Late Night on NBC from 1982 to 1993 before starting Late Show on CBS in 1993. In 2013, he surpassed Johnny Carson as the longest-running late night talk show host in television history. He has been part of more than 6,000 late-night broadcasts. Late Show has won six Emmy Awards for Outstanding Variety, Music or Comedy Program. Meanwhile, Late Night earned five Emmys and 35 nominations with Letterman at the helm.

After news of Letterman's departure broke, people quickly began posting tributes:

Letterman has had many memorable moments since his first guest (Bill Murray) on Late Night in 1982. Here are 10 highlights:

[nggallery id=15777]

A more social-media savvy Fallon took over for Leno, whose farewell on Feb. 6 attracted 14.64 million viewers compared with Fallon's 11.31 million pull for his debut, though Fallon's first episode is the show's second biggest audience since 2009, only behind Leno's exit. Both episodes trumped Conan O'Brien's 2010 opener (9.17 million).

On Twitter, however, Fallon edged out Leno, according to data Nielsen SocialGuide shared with Mashable. Roughly 79,900 unique accounts sent 157,600 tweets on Feb. 17, amounting to 15.6 million Twitter impressions (number of times tweets were seen). For Leno's last broadcast, 52,400 sent 79,400 tweets, which resulted in 9.9 million impressions.

Letterman entered network TV in 1978 on Mary Tyler Mooreâ€™s variety show Mary. That same year, he appeared nearly two dozen times on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson.

Moonves issued this full statement about Letterman's departure:

""When Dave decided on a one-year extension for his most recent contract, we knew this day was getting closer, but that doesnâ€™t make the moment any less poignant for us. For 21 years, David Letterman has graced our Networkâ€™s air in late night with wit, gravitas and brilliance unique in the history of our medium. During that time, Dave has given television audiences thousands of hours of comedic entertainment, the sharpest interviews in late night, and brilliant moments of candor and perspective around national events. Heâ€™s also managed to keep many celebrities, politicians and executives on their toes -- including me. There is only one David Letterman. His greatness will always be remembered here, and he will certainly sit among the pantheon of this business. On a personal note, itâ€™s been a privilege to get to know Dave and to enjoy a terrific relationship. Itâ€™s going to be tough to say goodbye. Fortunately, we wonâ€™t have to do that for another year or so. Until then, we look forward to celebrating Daveâ€™s remarkable show and incredible talents.""

The late night host debuted in 1982 with Late Night on NBC, then left in 1992 for Late Show on CBS, which debuted a year later.

Letterman's departure follows Jay Leno's from Tonight Show -- a spot that Letterman was once intended for -- which has since been taken over by Jimmy Fallon. This left most of us wondering who will claim the latest empty chair in late night comedy.

Though Letterman won't be leaving Late Show until 2015, Twitter is already speculating about the next host. Could it be Louis C.K.? Grumpy Cat? Guy Fieri?

One thing's for sure: The Internet has not failed to respond with both enlightening and absolutely ridiculous suggestions.

Some Final Four basics

Top overall seed Florida and seven-seed Connecticut get things started on Saturday at 6:09 p.m. ET. Then two-seed Wisconsin takes on eight-seed Kentucky on the same floor inside northern Texas' massive AT&T Stadium. That game is scheduled to tip at 8:49 p.m. ET, but could be pushed back if the first one runs long.

Since the games are on cable, you can't watch online unless you login with cable subscriber info (here's how to watch online).

March Madness broadcast partners CBS and Turner also have something new and special planned for this year's Final Four: team-specific broadcasts. This means you can tune into TNT or truTV during each game to get an alternate feed featuring intentionally slanted announcers calling the action.

During the first game, TNT will carry Florida's ""teamcast,"" while truTV carries the UConn version. During the second game, TNT will carry the Kentucky slant, while truTV carries the Wisconsin version. Sports Illustrated's Richard Deitsch has more information here(Opens in a new window).

And now for the Final Four teams.

Connecticut

Connecticut coach Kevin Ollie shouts instructions during the first half of a March Madness game against Iowa State on March 28, 2014. Credit: Frank Franklin II

Road to the Final Four: The Huskies finished the regular season with an overall record of 24-8, earning them a seven-seed in the tournament. Then they got hot and went on a major upset streak, taking out 10-seed St. Joseph's, then two-seed Villanova, then three-seed Iowa State and finally four-seed Michigan State to reach the Final Four. (One gambler rode some of that hot streak to $390,000 in winnings.)

Why to root for UConn: Come on, man -- they're the underdogs! Technically, Kentucky may have had a slightly worse seeding heading into March Madness, but Kentucky also has the most highly touted freshman class of all time, so the Huskies are the real -- no pun intended -- underdog squad here.

If that's not enough, UConn's 41-year-old coach Kevin Ollie (above) played under legendary UConn coach Jim Calhoun in the early '90s and has emerged from his mentor's shadow this season, just his second at the helm of the Huskies program.

If that's not enough, guard Shabazz Napier is well on his way to lifetime hero status in the entire Northeast. The small, speedy guard is averaging better than 23 points per game in the tournament and fought through a bloodied nose to lead last weekend's shocking win over Michigan State.

Why this might end in tears: Napier might reach the end of his bag of tricks. Ollie might get outsmarted by a more veteran coach on the biggest stage. This collection of players was never supposed to get this far. There are any number of reasons the wheels could all fall off for UConn this weekend -- which, in a way, is all the more reason to hope they don't.

The player you have to watch: Napier is the only possible choice here. He's a warrior and supremely entertaining. He deflects comparisons(Opens in a new window) to Kemba Walker, who led a magical UConn title run in 2011, but those comparisons are becoming pretty impossible to avoid. Here are some Napier highlights.

Florida

Florida guard Scottie Wilbekin (5) celebrates a basket against Dayton in their NCAA tournament game on March 29, 2014. Credit: John Bazemore

Road to the Final Four: Florida was the tournament's top overall seed, so was kind of expected to reach this point. In doing so, they knocked off 16-seed Albany, nine-seed Pittsburgh, four-seed UCLA and 11-seed Dayton.

Why to root for Florida: Let's see, a truly cohesive team that blends freshman talent with veteran leaders and players who have overcome personal hardships, led by a veteran coach who's been at the same school for nearly 20 years -- what's not to love? One could argue that this is exactly how bigtime college basketball is supposed to look.

Why this might end in tears: The Gators are Final Four favorites, and the pressure might get to them. They're also overdue for a loss; they haven't been defeated since a gutty guard made a buzzer-beating shot to take them down back on Dec. 2. Wait a minute. That guard's name was Shabazz Napier and that team was Connecticut. Uh-oh -- could we see a repeat of something like this?

The player you have to watch: Senior point guard Scottie Wilbekin is Florida's best player, the Southeastern Conference Player of the Year the Gators' clear-cut leader. But he nearly didn't even suit up for the team this year. In June, Donovan suspended him from the team indefinitely and encouraged him to transfer. Wilbekin was only able to stick around after he ""begged Donovan to allow him to stay and to work his way back to the team,"" the New York Times(Opens in a new window) reports. One Final Four run later, and that seems to be a good call by both parties.

Kentucky

Kentucky's Julius Randle goes up for a shot against Georgia on March 15, 2014. Credit: John Bazemore

Road to the Final Four: The Wildcats have had quite a journey. Their six-man freshman class was touted as the best of all time before the season. But when they struggled early, they were written off as overhyped and emblematic of everything wrong with modern college hoops. Now, they're peaking at just the the right time. They boast March Madness wins over nine-seed Kansas State, one-seed Wichita State, four-seed Louisville and two-seed Michigan to earn their Final Four berth.

Why to root for Kentucky: There's something perfect about the storyline we mentioned -- six teenagers judged and torn apart by adults for an entire season, who come together at just the right moment to prove all the doubters wrong.

Why this might end in tears: Those freshman are young, after all, and thats' something that could still catch up to them -- especially if they run into an experienced Florida squad in the national title game.

The player you have to watch: Freshman power forward Julius Randle is 6'9"" and 250 pounds of pure beast. His skill, strength and passion under the hoop are a pleasure to watch. This year's Final Four location means he's returning home to the Dallas area for what will almost certainly be his final collegiate games before leaving school early to enter the NBA Draft.

Road to the Final Four: The two-seed Badgers took down 15-seed American, seven-seed Oregon, six-seed Baylor and top seed Arizona to get to this point.

Why to root for Wisconsin: Teamwork. Help defense. The two-handed chest pass. The triple-threat stance. Picture-perfect jump-shots. Floor burns. Make no mistake -- these Badgers have real talent. But if your dear old granddad just hates the way young whippersnappers play the game today, Wisconsin is the Final Four team with the best shot of convincing him that good basketball still exists.

Why this might end in tears: If the Kentucky athletes get in a rhythm, or if Florida starts clicking on all-cylinders, or if Shabazz Napier goes on full Kemba Walker mode, then the Badgers just might not have the players to stick around. They're certainly the least sexy pick here, but then again, they're probably the most likely team to formulate a baller game plan then execute it to perfection.

The player you have to watch: Sam Dekker is Wisconsin's high flyer, but 6'11"" center Frank Kaminsky is our player to watch. He has a great shot out to three-point territory, and is tough and crafty under the basket, helping him make up for less-than-ideal athleticism.

He went for 28 points and 11 rebounds to help beat Arizona for a final berth last weekend, and may have even him earned himself a look from NBA teams. Here are highlights of Kaminsky going off for 43 points in a game earlier this year.

3 reasonable (but probably wrong) predictions

1. UConn's charming run ends at the hands of a more balanced and experienced Florida squad. The Gators win 72-64 and advance to the championship game.

2. Kentucky's talent proves too much for Wisconsin. The Badgers make it tough, but Kentucky's superstar freshman don't crack, and pull out the 69-65 win to advance.

3. It's experience versus raw talent in the national final, and raw talent wins out. The Kentucky freshman -- once billed as messiahs in sneakers, then dismissed as sulky underachievers -- bring their story full circle.

7032226,Spring's First Tornado Outbreak Is Underway,"A widespread outbreak of severe thunderstorms, including an elevated threat of strong tornadoes, is getting underway across the central and southern United States on Thursday. The areas at the greatest risk of severe weather stretch from Arkansas to southern Illinois, southward to northern Louisiana. States at the highest risk of seeing tornadoes also include parts of Kentucky and Mississippi, according to the Storm Prediction Center (SPC), which is part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).

The SPC has placed all of Arkansas in a ""moderate risk"" area for severe thunderstorms and tornadoes, which indicates a high confidence for severe weather. Counting areas in ""slight risk"" zones, NOAA said that nearly 52 million people are at risk of seeing severe weather through Thursday night.

The greatest threat for strong tornadoes and very large, damaging hail will last through this evening across Missouri and Arkansas, the SPC said in a press release. Later Thursday night, the storms may congeal into a series of lines or storm complexes, which would raise the risk for damaging straight line winds and reduce the tornado risk slightly.

Flood watches were also issued for the areas at risk of seeing strong thunderstorms on Thursday and Thursday night, since the thunderstorms are bringing heavy rainfall.

Bill Bunting, chief of operations at SPC, told Mashable that so far this year, the U.S. has seen just one-third of the typical number of tornadoes expected through the beginning of April. â€œThis is really the first regional severe weather event this spring,â€ he said. The cold winter played a major role in suppressing tornado formation during much of the winter months, since the configuration of the jet stream blocked warm, humid air from moving north out of the Gulf of Mexico.

Severe Weather Briefing for April 3,2014 http://t.co/ITxRJDSeWF(Opens in a new window)â€” NWS Memphis (@NWSMemphis) April 3, 2014(Opens in a new window)

Thursday's storms are the result of a collision of air masses along with strong disturbances at higher levels of the atmosphere. This time, warm and humid air is being drawn northward from the Gulf of Mexico, Bunting says, and this air is meeting a colder air mass behind a cold front sweeping into the central U.S. from the north and west. In Minnesota, on the other side of the front, more than a foot of snow is forecast to fall through Friday. Across the severe weather threat zone, temperatures are warm near the surface but cold aloft, which encourages air to rise and form clouds and precipitation. In addition, an upper level weather system is moving east from the Rockies, and this is providing the necessary wind shear to create long-lived, rotating thunderstorms.

Wind shear occurs when wind changes speed or direction with height, and it is a critical ingredient(Opens in a new window) for forming tornadoes.

Bunting says the greatest threat for strong tornadoes is from interstate 70 southward into Missouri, all of Arkansas, and portions of Kentucky, Tennessee, and Mississippi. At least one tornado in Missouri had already been confirmed as of Thursday afternoon.

Moderate risk days are relatively rare, with the U.S. averaging five such days during a typical April. Tornado season ramps up from now through early summer, and this year follows an unusually quiet season last year. Due to a lack of skill, given that tornadoes are such a localized phenomena, meteorologists do not yet issue seasonal tornado outlooks, so it is unclear what this tornado season has in store for the U.S.

One potentially significant wrinkle in ensuring public safety during this storm event is a series of outages affecting NOAA's websites. As of 3:40 p.m. ET, as the agency was issuing tornado watches and warnings, the SPC's website was down, as was the map on Weather.gov showing the national view of watches and warnings. These outages are not the first time that NOAA's websites have had hiccups during severe weather days.

Lt. Gen. Milley said the shooter was being treated for mental health and behavioral issues. The soldier had suffered a traumatic brain injury when he returned from Iraq, Gen. Milley said, and was being evaluated for post-traumatic stress disorder -- but not yet diagnosed.

Lopez, who used a .45 Smith & Wesson that he purchased in the local area, was assigned to 13th Sustainment Command. He opened fire in the 1st Medical Brigade area of Fort Hood.

Specialist Lopez reportedly walked into the building just before 5 p.m. CT on Wednesday and opened fire. He then hopped into a vehicle, drove a short distance to another building, entered it, and again opened fire. He was confronted by a female MP in a parking lot and then shot himself in the head.

Hasan, a Muslim, had been opposed to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Prosecutors and Hasan himself said that he feared being deployed to a war zone and wanted to commit jihad to protect fellow Muslims from American troops.

It seems the doors would be bullet proof, but apparently they're not,â€ his fiancÃ© Kristen Haley told wtsp.com(Opens in a new window).

Army Sgt. Timothy Owens, a 37-year-old Illinois soldier, was also killed(Opens in a new window) in the shooting.

Carlos Lazaney, 38, was the third soldier killed. ""It wouldn't surprise me if he was trying to evacuate people, because he's just that kind of guy,â€ a friend told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser(Opens in a new window) on Thursday.

Nine of the 16 injured were taken to Scott and White Memorial Hospital in Temple, Tex., doctors say. Three remained in critical condition on Thursday morning, while others are expected to be discharged later in the day. What happened to remaining seven who were injured remains unconfirmed.

""The [patients] who are awake and talking are in good spirits,"" Dr. Matthew Davis, trauma director at Scott and White Memorial, told reporters.

All of the critical patients are all suffering from gunshot wounds. One was hit in the neck, another has a potential spine injury, and the third is suffering from an abdominal injury. They are all on ventilators, and some will require additional surgery, Dr. Davis said.

All of the nine patients at the hospital, which is located just minutes from Fort Hood, where the shooting took place, are current military members; some are as young as 21, while others are in their 40s. Eight are male and one is female, and all are expected to survive.

Dr. Alexander Thompson, chairman of the hospital's Department of Psychiatry, said the shooting would be emotionally tough on the victims, many of whom have recently returned from trying tours of duty in Iraq or Afghanistan.

""The likelihood that somebody would have a difficult emotional response to [the shooting] is high,"" Dr. Thompson said. Many of the servicemen have returned and had combat experience, he said, noting that now experiencing this kind of violence at home would be tough on them.

Dr. Davis commended the staff at Fort Hood's Darnell Hospital for their exceptional job stabilizing the patients before sending them over to Scott and White Memorial in the moments after the incident.

7012343,Google Finally Split Its Stock,"Google's stock split officially went into effect on Thursday, almost exactly two years after the company first proposed the move to shareholders.

As part of the stock split, Google will introduce a new category of Class C stock, which will trade under the GOOG ticker, but carries no voting power. Shareholders will receive one share of Class C stock for each share of Class A stock they own. The original Class A shares will trade under a new stock ticker, GOOGL.

There is also a third class of stock -- Class B -- which carries 10 votes per share and is largely held by Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin and Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt. This setup ensures that the three top executives will maintain voting control over the company even as they sell off their shares over time.

The stock split was initially delayed as shareholders filed a lawsuit arguing that the move would unfairly benefit the founders. Google settled that lawsuit in mid-2013 by agreeing to pay up to $7.5 billion if there ends up being a big enough difference in the trading price of the Class A and Class C stock in the first year.

Google's stock topped $1,000 a share for the first time late last year, making it one of only a handful of companies to hit a four-digit trading price, and rose above $1,200 earlier this year. As a result of the stock split, the stock price has come back down from those heights.

The ad, which was posted(Opens in a new window) to YouTube early Thursday, will air on network and cable TV in six cities, including San Francisco, Detroit and Buffalo, N.Y. It is scheduled to run for seven weeks, starting on April 7, though a rep said the company is open to expanding on this particular ad.

In the controversial 2011 commercial, actor Timothy Hutton talks about turmoil in Tibet before abruptly shifting to a pitch for a Groupon deal on Tibetan food. Following the fallout, Groupon opted not to place TV ads in the U.S., though it did air commercials in the UK and India.

By comparison, the new commercial is fairly straightforward and harmless. The goal is to reintroduce consumers to the new Groupon, which is more of a destination for consumers to search for deals and products, rather than just being a service that e-mails deals each day.

""Weâ€™re a very different company than we were in 2011, and this is a great way for us to deliver the message that Groupon has evolved from a daily deal website into a searchable e-commerce marketplace with more than 140,000 deals accessible online and via mobile devices,"" Nicholas Halliwell, a Groupon spokesperson, told Mashable in a statement.

Groupon announced in its last earnings report that it plans to spend an additional $25 million on marketing for its online marketplace efforts. Groupon had previously focused resources on affiliate marketing, SEO and some display ads.

Messaging is a big deal for the folks at Vine (and Twitter). To see that, you need only install the latest update, which includes a roadblock prompting you to try the new feature.

This is how Vine Messaging starts the first time you open Vine 2.0 Credit: Screenshot

Vine itself looks a bit different even without the new Message option. Note the new ""Share"" icon (below, left). This features now lets you reshare a favorite Vine to multiple contacts (below, right). Each one will get the same Vine and a text message (if you choose to include that) in their message inbox.

After that, you can continue separate conversations with each friend about that Vine. You can't continue a group Vine chat.

Vine Messages is a new menu item found under the Home icon. Select it and youâ€™re in your Vine Message Inbox, which defaults to messages from Friends view. Each friend is color-coded according to the profile color they chose (another new feature).

You can also receive video and text messages from those who arenâ€™t your friends (people you donâ€™t necessarily follow on Vine). Vine may ask you, as it asked me, to enter your mobile phone number. That's needed to verify your account before you can send a video or text message to a contact who is not following you.

Anyone youâ€™ve recently messaged appears in this section; the conversations with them stay put. The time of your last correspondence is noted on each avatar. The number of messages appear with a tiny numeral on top of the avatar. You'll also hear what sounds like a little raindrop each time you send or receive a message. If you have notifications turned on for Vine, you'll also see a little drop-down alert on top of your screen whenever a new message arrives.

You can also access the inbox by swiping the home screen to the left.

New Vine messages appear as video or text. You can record up to six seconds per message, just as you can with a regular Vine video. All the features of Vine are available here. You can respond with with either video or text, or both at once. When you prepare to send a Vine message, thereâ€™s the option to add a caption.

If you delete a Vine video message or text, it may not disappear from your recipients' phone if they've viewed it. In my experience, I could only delete sent messages on my end. Canceling message before they go though is easy.

Here, I sent a video message (below, left) and followed it with a text message (below right).

Vine Messages also supports â€œQuick Reply.â€ To access this feature, just hold your finger on the video record icon. The camera will automatically switch to FaceTime or ""selfie"" mode, and start recording for up to 6 seconds. When you let go, the message is sent.

You can cancel the process by swiping your finger upwards -- but if you donâ€™t do it quickly enough, the message will go out and remain on your recipientâ€™s phone, even if you delete it from your own.

In short, Vine Messages is the single biggest update since Vine's introduction a little more than a year ago. It's more like a separate service stuffed inside the existing one. Now entire conversations and creations will be shared privately between Vine users. It's certainly much richer than Twitter's own Direct Message platform, and offers more creative possibilities than Instagram's direct messaging system.

The only question that remains: will it flourish like Snapchat, or fade into unused obscurity like Instagram DMs?",4/3/2014 0:00,0.450718,18,4,1,4.962687,7,00000,0,3573.086,1829.309,2738,0.512586,0.084317,0.035448,0.020522,0,0,1800
7032129,Imgur Emerges From Reddit's Shadow With $40 Million in Funding,"Photo website Imgur is taking a major step beyond its roots as an easy way for Reddit users to share photos with a $40 million round of funding.

The investment is the first outside funding for the site, which has quietly grown into one of the largest online hosts of images and gifs. The site boasts more than 130 million unique monthly users and more than 2 billion daily pageviews(Opens in a new window).

[seealso slug=http://mashable.com/2014/03/15/annoying-reddit/]

Alan Schaaf started Imgur out of his Ohio University dorm room in 2009. The site's origin is chronicled in a now famous post on Reddit(Opens in a new window) entitled: ""My Gift to Reddit: I created an image hosting service that doesn't suck. What do you think?""

The site quickly become the go-to host for Reddit users but grew beyond the site to begin generating its own traffic(Opens in a new window).

With Reddit, Schaaf found a fervent user base that helped the site grow rapidly while becoming profitable almost immediately.

""We've always been profitable from the very beginning,"" Schaaf told Mashable. ""The only money I've ever invested personally into the service was the $7 for the initial domain name. We've always been profitable. We've always been growing. We've more or less always been able to do the things we want to do.""

The site had been entirely self funded or ""bootstrapped"" in startup terms. However as the site grew beyond just a picture host for Reddit, so did the opportunities.

""We want to be a household name for self expression and viral images on the Internet,"" said Matt Strader, chief operating office of Imgur.

The money will be primarily used to hire engineers with particular attention to its mobile development, as well as to build a sales team and add infrastructure investments such as a larger office.

""Over time our ambitions have gotten bigger and now we have a vision that includes global Internet domination,"" he said. ""In order to achieve that, we just need to be bigger and better all around and that's just going to take more money and more experience.""

Schaaf declined to disclose the valuation of the company but did say that the site is still majority owned by its founders.

Imgur's revenue is driven by advertising including banner ads, sponsored images, an API for developers(Opens in a new window) and an analytics service(Opens in a new window) for sites that want to know more about the traffic a picture generates.

Taking money wasn't easy, Schaaf said. The company had met with a variety of investors before settling on Andreessen Horowitz, which will add Lars Dalgaard, a general partner at the firm and an executive with software company SAP, to Imgur's board.

""I would say it was a pretty hard decision,"" Schaaf said. ""It took us five years to make it.""",4/3/2014 0:00,0.587413,10,0,0,4.684091,10,Tech,2300.5,7275.6,3986.693,2200,0.493042,0.153541,0.036364,0.004545,0,0,1900

Braswell (14 nanometers) will succeed Intel's existing 22-nanometer Bay Trail chip. A nanometer is billionth the size of a meter.

The chip is expected to have better performance and be more power efficient than the Bay Trail chip, Intel said during the Intel Developer Forum in Shenzhen, China. The company didn't say when the chip will officially launch.

Intel also released its 64-bit Android kernel, which is used when software needs to send a request to the hardware (anything from volume level to device brightness).

7012284,The Internet in Cuba: 5 Things You Need to Know,"A misguided attempt by the U.S. government to create a Twitter-like social network in Cuba -- which ended with $1.6 million spent and just 40,000 users to show for it -- has put the state of the Internet on the communist island back on the spotlight.

Cuba has long been one of the least connected countries in the world. Indeed, the country rivals North Korea in the extent to which it has shut itself out from the Internet.

Here are five things you need to know about Internet freedom in Cuba, a country that blogger and Cuban dissident Yoani Sanchez calls ""the Island of the disconnected.""

1. Internet access is the greatest obstacle ...

In 2011, roughly 25% of Cubans had Internet access, according to the country's National Statistics Office(Opens in a new window) and the International Telecommunication Union. But that number is misleading -- it includes people that can only log into a government-controlled Intranet of state-approved websites.

Only 5% of Cubans actually have access to the open Internet, according to Internet freedom watchdog Freedom House(Opens in a new window). Home connections are practically nonexistent, and only government officials, academics, doctors, engineers, or regime-approved journalists have Internet access at work, says Ellery Biddle, a researcher who has focused on Cuban Internet issues for the last six years.

For everyone else, there are expensive government-run Internet cafes where an hour of connection can cost(Opens in a new window) between $6 and $10, a prohibitive amount of money in a country where the average weekly salary is around $20.

Where connection is possible, the speed is so slow there's very little they can do online but check email and sluggishly surf websites. ""When they do access the Internet, they try to do really the bare minimum,"" Cynthia Romero, the Latin America Senior Program Officer at Freedom House, tells Mashable.

Even computers are hard to come by. Until 2008 Cubans were barred from buying their own, which explains why Cuba's National Statistics Office reported in 2011 that there were only 783,000 computers in the whole country.

2. ... but there are creative workarounds

With such limited access, Cubans have employed more creative methods of surfing. One of the most popular is for people to download online articles onto thumb drives, then pass them around to friends and family.

This is sometimes called the ""sneakernet,"" though Sanchez calls it the ""Internet without Internet"" -- a callback to the 1990s, when Cubans used to cook the ""meat picadillo without meat"" because of food shortages.

""With one person connecting to the Internet, a hundred, two hundred, five hundred or a thousands are actually accessing information,"" Sanchez said during a talk(Opens in a new window) (embedded below) at the 2013 Google Ideas Summit in New York City.

Some Cubans with Internet access sell it to others or share accounts. Others build their own antennas or use illegal dial-up connections. But the Cuban government clamps down on these efforts with technicians ""sniffing"" neighborhoods for ham radios and satellite dishes, according to Freedom House.

Activists also use alternative ways to tweet, like texting or even ""speak-to-tweet(Opens in a new window)"" systems. Cubans can call a phone number in the U.S. and record an anonymous message that gets automatically converted to text and shared via Twitter or Facebook. These calls, however, can cost more than $1, making it an expensive workaround.

3. There's actually very little online censorship

When so few people have Internet access, you don't need to censor it that much. In terms of blocking content, Cuba is no China. News websites like The New York Times, or the Miami Herald are available, as are the sites of Human Rights Watch or Amnesty International.

Facebook and Twitter are accessible. YouTube is not.

There is a certain degree of censorship, especially when it comes to blogs run by anti-government activists like Sanchez. Her blog, Generation Y(Opens in a new window), is inaccessible, and so are others like BitÃ¡cora Cubana and Cubanet, according to Freedom House.

The Cuban government has also been prosecuting and silencing (Opens in a new window)dissident bloggers via arbitrary arrests, beatings and intimidation.

4. The Cuban government has a significant online presence

Despite limiting access, the Cuban government has a major footprint on the Internet. A 1,000-strong cyber militia, made up of students from the University of Computer Sciences(Opens in a new window) (UCI) of la Havana, are part of a so-called propaganda initiative called Operation Truth(Opens in a new window). They are tasked with discrediting government critics and promoting the government's agenda.

""The Cuban government has always been very good with information and disseminating its version of accounts,"" says Romer. ""So now they're starting to venture out more and more into the Internet and social media.""

The regime even has its own versions of Wikipedia and Facebook. Cuba's online encyclopedia is called Ecured(Opens in a new window), but it only has 78,000 articles and a small number of hand-picked editors. Social Red(Opens in a new window) was Cuba's short-lived response to Facebook.

5. Internet surveillance isn't sophisticated, but Cubans take it for granted

The government has a tight control on the country's telecommunications. There are only two Internet Service Providers; both are state-owned. Cubacel, a subsidiary of Cuba's telecom authority ETECSA, is the only cellular carrier.

With such control, Cuba doesn't need cutting-edge Internet surveillance tools, but it does have software like Avila Link(Opens in a new window), which collects private information from public computers and monitors Internet activity.

With real-world surveillance so widespread, Cubans ""are paranoid that someone may be watching,"" says Romero.

At Internet cafes, Cubans have to provide an ID to use a computer, making anonymous use of the Internet nearly impossible. With all that comes self-censorship -- and a sense of resignation.

""There's no expectation of privacy in most aspects of your life,"" says Biddle. ""I think people people generally expect [online surveillance].""",4/3/2014 0:00,0.63786,7,1,0,4.694779,4,00000,3573.086,5990.901,5015.954,64100,0.586724,0.047962,0.036145,0.036145,0,-0.2,1600
7012274,Will This iPhone Speaker Case Make Cycling Safer?,"Ever plugged headphones into your iPhone while riding a bicycle? Youâ€™re doing it wrong.

The Allo, a bike-mounted case with a speaker that gives cyclists headphones-free access to directions on their iPhone 5 or 5S â€“â€“ might be the right way. But not all cyclists agree.

SEE ALSO: Mattress Saves Cyclist Struck by Vehicle

Benji Miller, a 17 year-old high school student from Santa Monica, Calif. who invented The Allo, wanted to ""create a way for cyclists to use their smartphones while still being safe,"" he said on the device's website(Opens in a new window).

Miller's device, currently running a Kickstarter campaign, has an adjustable quick-release mount, a loudspeaker and a hardened plastic case to protect the smartphone. Riders can adjust the mount to decide their optimal viewing angle when using it.

Biking with headphones isnâ€™t a new trend, but it has claimed many cyclists' lives over the years. States such as Florida and Rhode Island have banned the use of any headphones(Opens in a new window). California, Delaware and Maryland only allows cyclists to use headphones in one ear only.

In the UK, Transport for London, the city's main agency for transport services, is considering an all-out ban on using headphones(Opens in a new window) after six cyclists died in two weeks. Lawmakers said they believe that headphones prevent cyclists from hearing sirens or horns, thereby causing accidents and endangering others on the road.

A study by scientists at the University of Groningen found(Opens in a new window) that â€œlistening to music worsens auditory perception, in particular if in-earbuds are used."" However, there is debate about whether or not such laws and studies are sound, since car drivers can crank up the stereo, and are still considered safe drivers.

The Allo speaker and case is powered by two AAA batteries. The sound it produces ranges from 80 to 90 decibels, which is as loud

Still, The Allo may not sit well with seasoned cyclists who believe riders should focus solely on the road, and ditch any type of device that can cause hearing damage and distraction. Neil Bezdek of Bicycling.com notes that with hearing loss, ""permanent damage can begin at 85 decibels,""(Opens in a new window) making the Allo's 80-90 decibel range (not counting the added decibels of traffic noise) problematic.

7012272,Changing Times Spur Startup Growth in Jerusalem,"It's been more than 2,000 years since Jerusalem(Opens in a new window) made a mark with technology.

That's when King Herod used the then-most modern construction methods to build his temple. Now, Mayor Nir Barkat is aiming to vault the ancient capital into the global fight for high-tech talent and investors.

""Cities that take off the fastest are those who know how to leverage strong science, strong art and strong management,"" Barkat, a 54-year-old former venture capitalist, said in an interview in his office. ""A city that develops a platform to enable and host more startups will be a city that is eventually more successful.""

It's an uphill battle. Barkat's got to transform Jerusalem's image from a zone wracked by conflict into a place to stay for graduates of Hebrew University's(Opens in a new window) computer-science program and the Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design. About half of the more-than 800,000-person population lives in poverty, mainly the ultra-Orthodox, who tend to opt out of the work force in favor of religious studies, and Arab residents, the Jerusalem Institute for Israel Studies(Opens in a new window) research institute says.

Innovation and entrepreneurship are prized in Israel, where technology contributes more than half of industrial exports and sales abroad account for about one-third of gross domestic product. The country is known as Startup Nation(Opens in a new window), stemming from a 2009 book(Opens in a new window) of the same title.

Catching up

Barkat, who backed the information-security company Check Point Software Technologies (CHKP)(Opens in a new window) Ltd., will need every bit of his investing experience to catch up to Tel Aviv. Israel's commercial hub is the world's second-best startup area behind Silicon Valley, according San Francisco-based Compass Inc(Opens in a new window)., which collects data on technology companies. It's also the base for Check Point(Opens in a new window) and about half its almost 3,000 employees.

Tel Aviv's labor-force participation rate was 65% in 2011, compared to Jerusalem's 46%, according to the Jerusalem Institute. The national average was 57%.

""Jerusalem's primary challenge is talent retention,"" said Avner Warner, a Tel Aviv-based member of the Compass team. ""To change the game, Jerusalem must and is working to create an environment that is attractive to young people.""

Moving back

An outdoor plaza at the former train station, the renovation of an old leper hospital into a Bezalel Academy(Opens in a new window) center for media and design, and an entertainment complex going up outside the Old City walls are part of Barkat's effort to do just that.

""The atmosphere is starting to change,"" said Dan Kaufmann, professor of business and management at Ben Gurion University in Beersheva. ""For the first time, I have research assistants who left Jerusalem for Tel Aviv(Opens in a new window) and are now considering moving back.""

Boosting the sentiment is a decrease in violence, from stabbings to shootings to suicide bombings, in a city where for years Israeli schools wouldn't even take class trips. Better-run Palestinian security forces in the West Bank(Opens in a new window) and a barrier built by Israel have helped lead to a drop in attacks.

""People now perceive Jerusalem as a much better place to come and study and learn,"" said Barkat.

The West Bank city of Ramallah(Opens in a new window), the Palestinian financial center about 78 kilometers (48 miles) from Tel Aviv, is also seeing startups flourish. There are about 250 technology firms in the West Bank and Gaza Strip(Opens in a new window), according to the Palestinian Information Technology Association of Companies(Opens in a new window) website.

Wrongway migration

While better security, culture and entertainment may help stanch migration from Jerusalem -- about 19,000 people left in 2012 while only 10,000 moved in, according to the Jerusalem Institute -- Barkat's success depends on the economy.

About half of jobholders are on the public payroll, with the largest percentage in education, health, social services and public administration. The average salary is about 7,600 shekels ($2,188) a month, below the national average and less than in Tel Aviv and Haifa, according to the Jerusalem Institute.

""The job market is the number one reason people leave,"" said Barkat, who has made retaining talented youth a top priority of his second term.

Creating better jobs is the goal of Barkat's effort, dubbed JNext. The initiative, jointly run by the municipality, the Ministry of Jerusalem and Diaspora Affairs and the Jerusalem Development Authority, offers startups reduced tax rates, relocation grants, and even help in paying employees' salaries for the first four years.

Dorm offices

For the 30 startups chosen for what JNext calls the High Tech Village, aid also comes in the form of offices in renovated 1950s-era Hebrew University dormitories.

Or Sharir, a 26-year-old computer-science graduate of Hebrew University from northern Israel, based his three-person company, here.a.story, in a former dorm room.

""Four years ago, I didn't really hear about things happening in Jerusalem other than Intel (INTC)(Opens in a new window) and Teva (TEVA)(Opens in a new window),"" he said, referring to the world's largest computer-chip maker, which is based in Silicon Valley, and the biggest maker of generic drugs, based in Petah Tikva(Opens in a new window), Israel. ""Now every week there are at least one or two events specifically for technology entrepreneurs.""

""I really love Jerusalem,"" said Sharir, whose application for mobile devices allows users to record a location-specific story for others to hear. ""There is something different here, a feeling of being small and big at the same time. There is magic in the streets.""

Events multiplying

The Jerusalem Development Authority(Opens in a new window), established to spur the economy, gave out 12 grants to startups in 2012 and 24 in 2013. It expects to distribute more this year. A company with a staff of between three and 10 can receive 50,000 shekels per employee. Events for high-tech entrepreneurs are multiplying. Twelve were held in the Israeli capital in 2012, and 110 last year. More than 40 events have already been put on this year.

The municipality(Opens in a new window) says 20 new kindergartens for the modern Orthodox and secular communities opened in the past 18 months, reflecting the growth in the city's budget -- 14% last year, compared with 5% in 2009 and 7.6% in 2010.

Jerusalem, whose residents make up about 10% of Israel(Opens in a new window)'s population, may begin to pull more talent from Tel Aviv after a high-speed train is up and running in 2017 and the expansion of the highway to coastal Tel Aviv, 70 kilometers away is complete, said Guy Preminger, high-tech leader at the business-advisory firm PricewaterhouseCoopers Israel.

""Today trying to get into Jerusalem is like Russian roulette -- you never know how long it will take,"" Preminger said. ""Once Jerusalem gets closer to Tel Aviv it will be possible to expand its ecosystem.""

The Weedmaps ad that was scheduled to debut in Times Square on Apr. 1, but was pulled for review before it could go up, was officially rejected by the CBS legal department on Tuesday, according to a Weedmaps spokesperson.

A member of the Weedmaps marketing team received a call from Neutron Media, the company which owns the Times Square billboard, Friday and was told Neutron was going to ask CBS to reconsider. The decision to pull the ad for good, however, was officially confirmed Tuesday. Weedmaps was not given a reason for the verdict and has not heard directly from CBS.

""I was disappointed,"" Aaron Houston, a strategist at Ghost Group, the company that owns Weedmaps, told Mashable. ""CBS' legal department seems to be behind the times.

The ad was purchased by Weedmaps(Opens in a new window), a medical marijuana review site where patients can post their accounts of anything from local dispensaries to doctors. It features a a 10-second looping video that displays the words ""HIGH, NYC"" on a light green background before revealing the name of the company which then vanishes into a cloud of smoke to show the site's URL and a hashtag -- #HighNYC. The planned spot was supposed to be displayed at 42nd Street between Seventh and Eighth avenues -- the heart of Times Square.

Neutron Media, the company which owns and manages the billboard, sent an email to Weedmaps in mid-March (which was forwarded to Mashable) approving the ad which was meant to present marijuana in a professional light. Even though it doesn't manage the advertising space, CBS can review content that it may not be comfortable associating with its brand since its logo appears on the billboard, the company said. CBS is currently reviewing the Weedmaps ad due to the nature of what it is promoting, according to a spokesperson. Weedmaps only found out that the ad wasn't running yet when they went to Times Square Wednesday morning to see it in action.

The National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws(Opens in a new window) (NORML) was scheduled to run a 15-second pro-legalization ad in 2010 -- on the same billboard as the Weedmaps spot -- but CBS abruptly reversed(Opens in a new window) its approval of the ad soon before it was supposed to go up. After a Change.org petition(Opens in a new window) garnered nearly 10,000 signatures, however, CBS went back(Opens in a new window) on this decision. NORML ran a second ad in Times Square later that year.

Inquiries about Weedmaps and legalization efforts from New York City residents have increased since adoption of pro-legalization legislation has been on the rise in the United States, according to a Weedmaps spokesperson. Neutron originally approached NORML about the current ad, but since a price in the low five figures wasn't in the organization's budget the opportunity got passed on to Weedmaps, the spokesperson said.

""A lot of change really needs to happen and this is another flash point in the evolving discussion,"" NORML spokesperson Erik Altieri told Mashable, referring to the Weedmaps ad.

Weedmaps has increased in popularity since it launched in 2008. It has seen a 30% growth year over year and had 2.7 million visitors just last month. Its Time Square ad was scheduled to run 18 hours a day for the next two months in addition to a guerrilla marketing campaign around New York City.

Colorado and Washington made waves in November 2012 when state residents voted to legalize recreational use of marijuana. The Compassionate Care Act, which could legalize medical marijuana in New York, has been passed by the state's assembly four times, but still hasn't been brought to a vote by the state Senate, the Huffington Post(Opens in a new window) reports. And it isn't for lack of support from locals -- nearly 90% of adult New Yorkers support the legal use of medical marijuana, according to a poll(Opens in a new window) done last month by Quinnipiac University.

Hartfield hasn't given up hope yet.

""I'm cautiously optimistic that CBS is going to do the right thing, however, if they don't we're going to explore other options,"" he said. ""This is America and people still want money, just like people still want weed.""

Neutron did not respond to a request for comment as of press time.

Editor's note: This article originally stated that the Weedmaps ad went up in Times Square on Tuesday morning. It has been updated at 12:58 p.m. ET on April 3 to reflect the fact that did not yet go up, but is currently being reviewed by the legal department at CBS.",4/3/2014 0:00,0.523077,8,2,0,4.641337,4,00000,2218.386,3573.086,2819.078,3400,0.4275,-0.15028,0.012158,0.027356,0.1,-0.1,524
7032093,M.I.A. and Janelle Monae Will Perform as Holograms in 3D Duet,"After Tupac Shakur ""performed"" as a hologram alongside Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre at Coachella in 2012, many wondered who'd be the next dead celebrity to appear onstage.

Turns out, you don't have to be dead: British rapper M.I.A. and singer Janelle Monae, who will both perform private solo concerts Thursday in different cities before teaming up at the end of their shows as life-sized 3D projections. Monae will be in Los Angeles, while a live-action hologram of M.I.A. in New York City will be beamed back to L.A. -- and vice-versa.

[seealso slug=""hologram-michael-jackson-will-i-am/""]

M.I.A. and Monae's duet is part of automobile manufacturer Audi's A3 line launch events across the country. U.S. dealerships will stream the concerts for employees and guests.

""The set uses 3D projection mapping and adds layered depth of field perception and animated graphic content,â€ an Audi spokesperson told Mashable.

This isn't the first holographic stunt since Tupac's virtual comeback. Last year, hip-hop collective Wu-Tang Clan resurrected(Opens in a new window) Ol' Dirty Bastard as a hologram. Meanwhile in 2013, rumors of R&B group TLC reviving Lisa ""Left Eye"" Lopes as a computer-generated performer fizzled.

With both artists being alive, the duet begs another question, ""What can other musicians do to entertain fans as holograms?"" Just think of the potential opportunities for future stunts -- whether this be for creating stunning moments onstage with their deceased musical brethren or turning themselves into computer-generated performers.

Mashable will have photos and video of Thursday's performances later this week.

7012226,Search for Missing Malaysian Plane Proves How Much Trash Is in Our Oceans,"Searchers scouring the waters of the Indian Ocean off Australiaâ€™s west coast have not yet succeeded in locating the missing Malaysian Airlines Boeing 777-200, but they have focused global attention on just how many pieces of manmade detritus is floating in our oceans.

Search personnel have referred to the trash, which ranges in size as small as a plastic water bottle to as large as a 70-foot long shipping container, with different descriptors, from garbage to the more unfamiliar and nautical term â€œflotsam(Opens in a new window).â€

Although the search area is not located in the famous Great Pacific Ocean â€œgarbage patch(Opens in a new window),â€ it is located at the edge of one of five â€œgyresâ€ where ocean currents and the atmospheric circulation draws in waste like a magnet.

â€œAt least this is letting the world know that garbage patches are not confined to the Pacific,â€ said Captain Charles Moore, whose work first drew the worldâ€™s attention to the Pacific garbage patch. â€œThe ocean itself has become this plastic soup,â€ Moore told Mashable.

â€œFamilies seeing this happen must feel terrible that theyâ€™re being told their deceased relatives and friends are in a garbage patch,â€ Moore said.

Moore founded the Algalita Marine Research Institute that works to raise awareness and help reduce the amount of plastic pollution that goes into the worldâ€™s oceans, where it can remain for decades. Such trash harms wildlife, damages ships, and as seen in the current search for the missing plane, can frustrate urgent search and recovery operations.

Studies have shown that about 90% of the trash in the ocean is plastic, Moore says, and that there are probably up to 10,000 lost shipping containers drifting along with ocean currents around the world.

Pollution can magnify other challenges the oceans face. A new climate change report released this week predicts sweeping changes in marine life in the coming decades due to warming and acidifying seas, with pollution adding to the stress on marine species.

According to Moore, shipping companies do not have to report lost containers when they go overboard, despite the fact that they constitute a hazard to other vessels, as was driven home in the recent Robert Redford film â€œAll Is Lost(Opens in a new window)â€.

According to Marcus Eriksen, the executive director and co-founder of the environmental advocacy group 5 Gyres, trash in such gyres usually drifts with the currents at about the same pace as a person walks. This means that if there is aircraft debris in the vicinity of the Indian Ocean Gyre, it is likely to be about 100 miles or more away from its original location.

The gyres have relatively slow-moving currents because they are located in areas where high pressure systems tend to dominate the weather, leading to light winds and docile seas. This can prevent trash from escaping a gyre for months or more. For this reason, Moore likens the gyres to â€œa toilet that doesnâ€™t flush.â€

Eriksen, who used to work with Moore but decided to set out on his own expanded effort to focus attention on all of the worldâ€™s garbage patches, rather than just the massive one in the Pacific, told Mashable that much of the waste in the five subtropical gyres consists of derelict fishing gear, in addition to plastic. â€œBecause itâ€™s designed to last forever it actually does,â€ Eriksen says.

Despite what many people think, he says, plastic bags donâ€™t usually make it to the middle of a gyre, since they tend to disintegrate into flecks that fish then consume.

Eriksen says that during trips to all five gyres, he has come across many low quality durable goods, including umbrella handles, bottle caps, Starbucks straws and forks and knives. â€œItâ€™s almost like a department store washed ashore when you come into these gyres,â€ Eriksen says.

In 2013, Eriksen sailed into the Bay of Bengal from Sri Lanka, and found an unusually large amount of trash floating off the coast of Sri Lanka and other South Asian countries with lax environmental regulations. â€œIt is unreal how much trash is floating in the Bay of Bengal,â€ he says. Trash from the Bay can cross the equator and enter the Indian Ocean gyre, which partly encompasses the Flight 370 search area.

Trash there is most likely coming from a variety of distant places, Eriksen said, including the Bay of Bengal, South Asia, Africa and parts of the Southern Ocean north of Antarctica.

In fact, Eriksen said his research indicates that all subtropical gyres are connected, with trash moving between them over time. â€œThose three gyres communicate,â€ he said. In June, Eriksen's group is planning to study plastic pollution in the North Atlantic and Viking Gyres, and is running a video contest(Opens in a new window) to bring a member of the public along with them.

What are the solutions?

While the current trash problem exists at sea, and appears to be worsening as plastics production increases worldwide, particularly in nations that donâ€™t have stringent environmental protections, advocates say most of the solutions would need to take place on terra firma -- back on solid ground.

Both Eriksen and Moore said they are seeking to alter the very paradigm of capitalism regarding manufacturers' responsibility for the end disposal of their products.

They say the plastics industry needs to take responsibility for their products from manufacturing to disposal. If youâ€™re going to make products made of plastic, Eriksen says, â€œyouâ€™ve got to have a plan for its whole life.â€

As Moore put it in an interview, every item that is built needs to have a â€œreincarnation pathwayâ€ for being reused or broken down in such a way that it cannot wind up traveling the global seas, going from gyre to gyre like a baton stuck in an endless relay race.

Such a plan could consist of providing incentives to consumers to return used plastic items for a financial gain, much as is currently done with aluminum soda cans. Similarly, Eriksen said fishermen could be given a monetary incentive to haul in and return used fishing gear that they find floating in the open ocean. Also, alternatives to plastic items could be used in many settings, such as by switching out plastic straws for paper ones at coffee shops like Starbucks, Eriksen says.",4/3/2014 0:00,0.536364,14,10,0,4.745455,9,00000,2232.261,8515.966,4395.179,803,0.396625,0.135124,0.042424,0.009091,0.454545,0.136364,4400
7012215,Mozilla CEO Steps Down After Anti-Gay Marriage Controversy,"Brendan Eich has stepped down as CEO of Mozilla, a company he cofounded, following significant criticism for his earlier support of a legal measure banning gay marriage.

""Brendan Eich has chosen to step down from his role as CEO,"" Mitchell Baker, executive chairwoman of Mozilla, wrote in a blog post(Opens in a new window). ""Heâ€™s made this decision for Mozilla and our community.

Eich, a prominent programmer who previously created Javascript, took over as the non-profit company's CEO on March 24. Shortly after, a number of Mozilla employees publicly urged(Opens in a new window) Eich to step down from the role, in reaction to a donation he made to the Proposition 8 effort, which sought to ban same-sex marriage in California in 2008. (Half the company's board also resigned(Opens in a new window) after his appointment, though Prop 8 was not cited as the reason.)

The tipping point, however, appeared to come on Monday when OkCupid posted a notice to anyone using Firefox, a Mozilla product, urging them to switch browsers. ""Mozilla's new CEO, Brendan Eich, is an opponent of equal rights for gay couples,"" OkCupid wrote in the notice. ""We would therefore prefer that our users not use Mozilla software to access OkCupid.""

In interviews with multiple publications this week, Eich emphasized that his personal beliefs outside the office are not relevant inside the office.

""It may be challenging for a CEO, but everyone in our community can have different beliefs about all sorts of things that may be in conflict,"" Eich said in an interview with CNET(Opens in a new window) published on Tuesday. ""They leave them at the door when they come to work on the Mozilla mission.""

Just two days later, however, Eich and Mozilla decided otherwise.

""We didnâ€™t act like youâ€™d expect Mozilla to act,"" Mozilla's Baker wrote in the blog post. ""We didnâ€™t move fast enough to engage with people once the controversy started. Weâ€™re sorry. We must do better.""

The full statement from Mozilla is below:

Mozilla prides itself on being held to a different standard and, this past week, we didnâ€™t live up to it. We know why people are hurt and angry, and they are right: itâ€™s because we havenâ€™t stayed true to ourselves.

We didnâ€™t act like youâ€™d expect Mozilla to act. We didnâ€™t move fast enough to engage with people once the controversy started. Weâ€™re sorry. We must do better.

Brendan Eich has chosen to step down from his role as CEO. Heâ€™s made this decision for Mozilla and our community.

Mozilla believes both in equality and freedom of speech. Equality is necessary for meaningful speech. And you need free speech to fight for equality. Figuring out how to stand for both at the same time can be hard.

Our organizational culture reflects diversity and inclusiveness. We welcome contributions from everyone regardless of age, culture, ethnicity, gender, gender-identity, language, race, sexual orientation, geographical location and religious views. Mozilla supports equality for all.

We have employees with a wide diversity of views. Our culture of openness extends to encouraging staff and community to share their beliefs and opinions in public. This is meant to distinguish Mozilla from most organizations and hold us to a higher standard. But this time we failed to listen, to engage, and to be guided by our community.

While painful, the events of the last week show exactly why we need the web. So all of us can engage freely in the tough conversations we need to make the world better.

We need to put our focus back on protecting that Web. And doing so in a way that will make you proud to support Mozilla.

Whatâ€™s next for Mozillaâ€™s leadership is still being discussed. We want to be open about where we are in deciding the future of the organization and will have more information next week. However, our mission will always be to make the Web more open so that humanity is stronger, more inclusive and more just: thatâ€™s what it means to protect the open Web.

We will emerge from this with a renewed understanding and humility â€” our large, global, and diverse community is what makes Mozilla special, and what will help us fulfill our mission. We are stronger with you involved.

7012194,"Nest Finds Flaw in Smoke Detector, Halts Sales","Silicon Valley darling Nest, the home appliance startup snapped up by Google in January for $3.2 billion, has discovered a flaw in its second product, the Nest Protect smoke detector -- a flaw big enough for Nest to halt sales Thursday.

The flaw in question has to do with a feature called Nest Wave, which allows users to turn off the smoke and carbon monoxide alarm by waving their hands in front of it. Nest has discovered that the feature could be activated by accident.

""During recent laboratory testing of the Nest Protect smoke alarm, we observed a unique combination of circumstances that caused us to question whether the Nest Wave could be unintentionally activated,"" wrote Nest founder and CEO Tony Fadell in a blog post(Opens in a new window). ""This could delay an alarm going off if there was a real fire.""

Fadell stressed that he was halting sales ""until we fix this issue"" out of an abundance of caution. ""We identified this problem ourselves and are not aware of any customers who have experienced this,"" he wrote, ""but the fact that it could even potentially happen is extremely important to me and I want to address it immediately.""

Customers who've already bought a Nest Protect are not being asked to return them. Rather there's an automatic update that will disable Nest Wave within the next 24 hours. Any users who don't have their Nest connected to a Wi-Fi network are being asked to discontinue using their Protect. Those who want a full refund will be given one.

Fadell anticipates that it will take ""two to three months"" to fix the Nest Wave issue, at which time it will be automatically turned back on.

7012182,Nokia Lumia 930: Is This the Future of Windows Phone?,"Nokia phones can be a little extreme. The Lumia 1020 has a camera with a ridiculous amount of resolution. The Lumia 1520 is crazy large. Even the company's feature phones have some wild colors and price points.

That's why it was refreshing to check out the Nokia Lumia 930. It's a phone that has a good screen and specs, but isn't dominated by any one feature. Very similar to the Nokia Icon, the Lumia 930 is a solid, modern Windows Phone that feels good to use.

[seealso slug=""microsoft-cortana-siri""]

When you pick up the Lumia 930, you can tell it's a Nokia phone from the feeling of the colored matte backside, the combination of soft curves and harder front edges, and the girth, which is slightly thicker than most smartphones these days.

Once you turn on the screen, however, you can tell this phone has something a little more special than your average Lumia. The 5-inch display has full HD (1,920 x 1,080) resolution, and it really pops.

This is about as small as a 1080p Windows Phone can comfortably be. The live tiles would just be too tiny at smaller sizes.

Apps, photos and media-rich websites look excellent on the screen. Those sites load fast, too. Calling up the New York Times website -- the desktop version, complete with photos, ads and the stock ticker -- took just a second or two, thanks in large part to the phone's Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 chip.

The camera is a 20-megapixel imager, just like the Lumia 1520's. It has the same option to use the standard camera app or the Nokia Camera, which includes onscreen controls for changing your ISO, white balance and other professional settings.

Photos look very sharp on the screen. If your lighting is good enough and your hands are steady, you'll be able to see lots of detail even when you zoom in. The results are not as good as the 1020's 41-megapixel photos -- but in a photo of a crowded room, I was able to see that a speck on a laptop in the background was actually an Apple logo.

I also got a chance to check out a little of the new features in Windows Phone 8.1. The calendar app, for one, is much improved. I really liked the fact that tapping on a day in the week view would ""maximize"" that day's events without overpowering the other days. And the Action Center provides something the OS was sorely lacking: a central hub for notifications.

Overall, the look, feel and capabilities of the Nokia Lumia 930 are very much the same as the Lumia Icon -- but that was an impressive phone to begin with. Enhanced by Windows Phone 8.1, it's now ready to go toe-to-toe with the likes of the HTC One M8 and Samsung Galaxy S5.",4/3/2014 0:00,0.599174,1,1,2,4.389344,7,Business,0,8667.118,3854.856,8600,0.493277,0.08267,0.016393,0.016393,0,0,1700

The dating site protested Mozilla on Monday by discouraging users to visit its site via Firefox, in an attempt to bring awareness to Eich's 2008 political donation in support of Proposition 8. The ballot measure, which outlawed gay marriage in California, passed but was later ruled unconstitutional. OkCupid's stunt attracted media attention, and added to displeasure around the web about Eich's political views and the company's decision to promote him to CEO in late March.

[seealso slug=""legalization-gay-marriage-england-wales""]

On Thursday, Mozilla announced(Opens in a new window) in a blog post that Eich was stepping down, apologizing to users for failing to act in a more timely manner. ""We didnâ€™t act like youâ€™d expect Mozilla to act,"" wrote Mozilla Chairwoman Mitchell Baker. ""We didnâ€™t move fast enough to engage with people once the controversy started. Weâ€™re sorry. We must do better.""

The news was appreciated at OkCupid. The company released the following statement through a spokesperson:

â€œWe are pleased that OkCupidâ€™s boycott has brought tremendous awareness to the critical matter of equal rights for all individuals and partnerships; todayâ€™s decision reaffirms Mozillaâ€™s commitment to that cause. We are satisfied that Mozilla will be taking a number of further affirmative steps to support the equality of all relationships.â€

On Monday, OkCupid greeted Firefox users trying to visit its site with a message encouraging them to try other browsers like Chrome, Internet Explorer, or Safari. The pop-up did not specifically call for Eich's resignation, but it certainly didn't mince words, either. The message said: ""Those who seek to deny love and instead enforce misery, shame, and frustration are our enemies, and we wish them nothing but failure.""

That wish came true Thursday, and while OkCupid is not taking full credit for the change at Mozilla, the company does believe its protest made a difference.

OkCupid cofounder Sam Yagan told Mashable in an email: ""Itâ€™s a great feeling to see a company take a stand that blends its business interests and its principles and have that stand result in a series of actions that makes the world a better place."" Mashable also reached out to Barry Diller, Chairman of AIC, OkCupid's parent company, but did not receive a response.

Mozilla has not yet named a new CEO and will have more information ""next week,"" according to Baker. In the meantime, the company appears to be working hard to retain users and avoid more negative attention, ensuring users that the company is open to all people, regardless of sexual orientation.

But he's not just lifting weights -- oh, no. He's flipping giant tires! He's using a rope to pull an automobile toward him while seated on the ground! He's pushing a pickup truck around campus with nothing but his bare hands, gigantic muscles and sheer force of will!

But mind-boggling offseason workouts like that are actually the norm for Florida's basketball team. They're the brainchild of one Preston Greene, who is the team's strength and conditioning coordinator.

""It's not easy,"" star point guard Scottie Wilbekin told Sports Illustrated(Opens in a new window)'s Greg Bishop of the workouts earlier this week. ""It's not fun. I don't really like that stuff. But it's a necessary part of the process.""

Greene tells SI that the savage workouts are a key to the toughness that's helped the team reach this year's Final Four, and that he and the other coaches use them as fodder to motivate the Gators through tough moments.

""Guys, you've pushed trucks 100 yards up a hill, outside, in the heat,"" he tells the players. ""There's nothing you can't handle now.""

We'll find out how true that is when Florida takes on upset-minded underdog Connecticut in the Final Four's first game, which tips off Saturday at at 6:09 p.m. ET.",4/3/2014 0:00,0.672131,7,2,0,4.387597,7,Tech,2705.581,3573.086,3118.331,3400,0.535701,0.239773,0.077519,0.015504,0.7,0.55,4800

While its initial website did cease operations about a month ago, the program has moved to a new url - popcorn-time.tv. The app remains operational through its GitHub page(Opens in a new window).

Popcorn Time, the sleek streaming app for pirated movies, has remerged after briefly disappearing from its website and GitHub.

The program was taken over by the community and has changed URLs a few times, currently residing at popcorn-time.tv(Opens in a new window)

The app provides users with the ability to play movies through torrents with one click. Popcorn Time's interface has led to comparisons with Netflix for its easy navigation and use of visuals.

The service gained popularity particularly outside the U.S., where movie restrictions can put serious limits on the availability of content. Although the app is now unavailable, copycats have already sprung up across the Internet.

Popcorn Time announced that it was ceasing operations about a month ago in a blog post(Opens in a new window):

""Popcorn Time is shutting down today. Not because we ran out of energy, commitment, focus or allies. But because we need to move on with our lives.

Our experiment has put us at the doors of endless debates about piracy and copyright, legal threats and the shady machinery that makes us feel in danger for doing what we love. And thatâ€™s not a battle we want a place in.

The original app may have been shut down but the idea has spread. Other clones with similar names have already emerged. Users should be cautious about these other programs, as they can contain viruses.

""The bulk of our users is not in the US. It's everywhere else. Popcorn Time got installed on every single country on Earth. Even the two that don't have internet access,"" the company wrote.

The program provides users with access to the complex world of torrents without needing to learn the ins and outs of clients, downloaders, seeds and peers.

â€œAs a designer I love the challenge of simplification. Take something hard for the common user and make it usable. I have a lot of friends who donâ€™t understand torrents and I wanted to make it easy and effortless to use torrent technology,â€ one of the app's designers said in an interview with Torrent Freak(Opens in a new window).

7011862,8 Apps to Turn Your Pipe Dreams Into Prototypes,"Depending on who you listen to, ideas are either bulletproof, cheap, and powerful or like an unmentionable part of your body. Everyone has ideas. Every conference, meetup, hackathon, startup weekend event is filled with people who have ideas but lack the ability to build them. Countless people are trying to raise funding or get a technical co-founder with little more than a few bullet points on a piece of paper. It's pointless. Ideas without execution aren't worth the paper they're written on.

The difficulty for a lot of people is getting from that idea to something more tangible, and it can seem impossible if you don't have any technical or design skills. But in fact, it's a lot easier than you might think. Using one, or a combination of the tools below will allow you to create a tangible prototype, and build something you can use to show a potential co-founder, colleague, customer or investor what your idea is and how it works.

These tools will allow you to create everything from a clickable version of your sketches to a more fully featured, proper prototype which can be used to raise funding, gauge interest or validate a potential market. They're all things that anyone can download or load up and start using in minutes - no technical or design skills are necessary.

1. Pop(Opens in a new window)

Almost unbelievably simple, Pop can sketch out your idea on paper, take photos and then make those images clickable within the app. It makes it simple to add transitions and export a version so that people can get hands on and start messing around with your idea.

2. Balsamiq(Opens in a new window)

Only slightly more complicated than Pop, Balsamiq is a simple wire-framing tool. In a nutshell, it allows you to mock up the user interface of a website, app or idea in a few minutes. The joy of Balsamiq is that it has pre-built widgets that you can just drag and drop onto a web or mobile template. As a first step in figuring out what your idea should look like, you can't go wrong with this one. It's usually my first port of call when I'm trying to figure out how an idea could work or look.

3. Keynotopia(Opens in a new window)

This is another personal favorite. Keyntopia is basically a collection of templates for Keynote or Powerpoint. Using these templates and the design components that you get as part of the package will allow you to create a pretty sophisticated-looking mockup using nothing more than rudimentary presentation design skills. If you're more technically minded (i.e. you know how to do a screengrab) you can do a lot more. Best of all, you can add clickable areas to your 'presentation' and export it as a clickable prototype in multiple formats.

4. FluidUI(Opens in a new window)

If Google and NASA are using a tool, it stands to reason that it must be good. That's definitely the case with FluidUI. As with Balsamiq and Keynotopia, there are thousands of built in widgets and components that you can drag and drop onto your design. It's easy to share mockups and give people an idea of how your product will work and feel. It's also really easy to bring your own elements into the mockups to customize them even more.

5. AppCooker(Opens in a new window)

AppCooker allows you to prototype ideas on your iPad. Import flat images from Dropbox, Box and other services, make them clickable with a few taps and export them for people to test. Perhaps most interestingly, AppCooker also includes modules that allow you to test revenue assumptions around the app - which is always a helpful thing to do.

6. Proto.io(Opens in a new window)

Not only is Proto.io unbelievably fast. It also has some of the best demo videos in the marketplace at the moment. Their tool is similar to the apps mentioned above, but it also allows you to animate certain elements of the UI, which makes for a far nicer looking prototype. It also gives the option of getting feedback from testers, colleagues and guinea pigs - who can annotate your designs and help refine them. Check out some of the examples on their site to see just how powerful this can be. It's particularly worthwhile if you're looking at prototyping something that functions on multiple devices - from cameras to consoles through to phones and tablets.

7. Invision(Opens in a new window)

Similar to Proto, Invision is a more focused on rapid prototyping for designers. It allows them to put their designs into a clickable, scrollable format and share it with colleagues and others to get feedback. It might not be one for a total beginner, but as you get bigger and better and start working with more collaborators, it could be a very valuable piece of software to have.

8. Demonstrate(Opens in a new window)

Similar to Pop, Demonstrate allows you to pull in images from your Dropbox account, make them clickable and add transitions to give you an idea of how an idea might work as an app.

There are dozens of similar and more complicated tools out there. This is by no means an exhaustive list, but it represents a selection of the ones that anyone can use - regardless of their technical/design ability.

7012039,I Used the Internet to Quit Smoking,"I started smoking for the same reasons most people begin the nasty habit: I was young and stupid.

Like many teenagers, I could care less about the negative aspects of smoking. Money wasn't yet a burden on my everyday existence, the long term effects meant little to nothing and I had myself convinced that quick spritz of spray deodorant and some gum masked the smell well enough.

The truth was that smoking, once a fun and social activity then began to control my life.

Don't get me wrong, I still enjoyed smoking. In fact, I loved smoking.

Smoking was always there for me. It helped alleviate stress, introduced me to most of my good friends, it felt amazing and played a huge role in my daily routine. I would sneak a smoke break anywhere I could, and living in a city always provided a few moments to puff, when waiting for the bus or walking between destinations.

The beginning of the end

At age 22 I was up to a full pack a day, sometimes more. My family begged me to quit, but you can't just tell someone to stop smoking -- they have to hit rock bottom, they have to want it.

A few years later, at age 24 I was living in New York, the most expensive city in the United States, where cigarette prices are over $12 a pack. There was now no way for me to further delay my mountainous, six-figure student loan debt. I simply couldn't afford to smoke anymore, and quite frankly, I didn't want to.

Then a friend posted an Instagram of her Timehop(Opens in a new window) app. The nostalgia-based app allows you to see your photos and social media updates from exactly one year prior. Someone with whom I had once enjoyed many cigarettes had made it a full year without smoking, and I desperately wanted the same.

After some encouragement from friends and family, I started to seriously consider quitting for real. I had tried a few times before, but I had never put any calculated effort towards it.

I began researching popular methods people use to quit, and stumbled upon an online support group on Reddit, r/stopsmoking(Opens in a new window). The encouraging community is a place for Redditors who seek motivation to quit, and is filled with stories, words of encouragement and advice. A yellow badge appears next to your username with a number, signifying the number of days since quitting.

Credit: Reddit

Once I immersed myself in the subreddit, I found that the community extremely friendly and helpful. Unlike other places on the Internet, there were no trolls or hateful words toward those who sought advice.

I quit

Although I had yearned to quit, and had done some research in the method and practice I thought best for me, I never picked a specific time to quit. But when I awoke on New Year's Day with a splitting headache, reeking of an ash tray, I figured now was as good a time as ever. The hangover alone was enough to make me not want to smoke, so I knew the first day wouldn't be so bad.

Searching for methods to quit smoking on the Internet is like searching for weight loss tips -- there are thousands of different approaches that all claim to be the best, but not all is right for you.

The patch seemed too weird for me, the gum made my mouth itch, prescription medication was definitely out; I had no insurance, e-cigarettes hadn't caught on yet, and reading a self-help book just made me feel like a drug addict, which I was.

One method that did peak my interest was apps. Along with cigarettes, my phone was the only other thing I couldn't leave my apartment without, and now it was my only clutch.

There are hundreds of apps geared towards quitting smoking. I downloaded an app called QuitIt(Opens in a new window), because it had good ratings, it was free and wasn't as invasive or time-consuming as some others.

The app is geared toward information as motivation. You plug in the amount of cigarettes you smoke, cost per pack and the time you quit smoking. The app does the math and delivers you information based on your specifics.

The status screen tracks the amount of time since you quit, the money you've saved, cigarettes not smoked and the tar associated with that number. The app also includes a number of health goals, which monitors your progress as time continues.

Utilizing the app

Quitting smoking was one of the hardest things I've ever had to do. Like most quitting stories, I did get a little sick, I was irritable and I felt terrible, but the most difficult part was the empty feeling I was left with. I felt as if nothing was ever going to be the same -- any activity I had once enjoyed while smoking was simply never going to be as good as it was with a cigarette in hand.

My morning coffee just wasn't like it was before. I drank alone inside bars as my friends braved the cold weather for their vice, and even though my appetite did increase, meals weren't as satisfying without a cigarette for dessert.

Any time I had a craving, I would open the app, and track the progress I had made. If I had a craving while I was on the computer, I'd immediately go to r/stopsmoking, to read a success story, or to offer someone else having a harder time than me support. It was like complaining about a sprained ankle at the doctor's office when the person next to you doesn't have any legs at all.

After just a week or two, I started to notice a difference in my health and hygiene, especially in my mouth. Once the initial shock wore off, sleeping became easier, although occupied with strange, lucid dreams And I began to think about cigarettes less and less.

The app worked for me because of its no-nonsense vibe. The ads are small and barely noticeable, it isn't overloaded with features and functions, it loads quickly and isn't a battery killer.

Other apps like Kwit(Opens in a new window) use game design techniques to encourage quitting.

The app Livestrong(Opens in a new window) which calls itself a ""MyQuit Coach"" combines game design, community and motivational information. It was a little frustrating to use, however, and the popups just made me want to smoke more.

A lot of apps also feature the humble, social media brag element, allowing you to connect your social media accounts to the app. For me, the thought of failure was worse once I boasted to my followers about how far I had come with my addiction.

Not smoking is still an everyday struggle, and probably will be for the rest of my life. Although my QuitIt(Opens in a new window) app slowly moved from the home screen on my iPhone, to the third screen, back among other forgotten and hardly used apps, I have no desire to delete it.

7031858,Senate Committee to Release CIA Torture Report,"The Senate intelligence committee voted 11-3 on Thursday to declassify significant pieces of an investigation into torture methods used by the Central Intelligence Agency against prisoners suspected of terrorism.

The report runs 6,300 pages; it is said to uncover CIA extralegal detentions and torture techniques used on suspected terrorists during President George W. Bush's administration. It also alleges that abusive interrogations did not lead to useful intelligence, and that the CIA lied to Congress and the President about the interrogation program's effectiveness.

Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-Cal.), the committee chair who has led the charge to release the report, said she was shocked by what the investigation uncovered.

""The report exposes brutality that stands in stark contrast to our values as a nation,"" Feinstein said in a statement(Opens in a new window). ""It chronicles a stain on our history that must never again be allowed to happen.""

While Feinstein hopes that the whole report will be released in the long run, the initial rollout will feature the executive summary, findings, conclusions and contrarian opinions.

The CIA believes the report is riddled with factual errors, as does the committee's vice chairman, Senator Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.). He voted in favor of releasing the report, but only so Americans could judge the findings for themselves.

â€œWhile I agree with some of the conclusions in this report, I take strong exception to the notion that the CIAâ€™s detention and interrogation program did not provide intelligence that was helpful in disrupting terrorist attacks or tracking down Osama bin Laden,"" Chambliss said in a statement(Opens in a new window). ""This claim contradicts the factual record and is just flat wrong.""

Other senators who voted in favor of the release have chastised investigators for not interviewing CIA agents or Republican committee members, according to The Guardian(Opens in a new window).

The vote comes at a time when tensions are running high between the CIA and the Senate. In early March, Feinstein accused the CIA of spying on staffers who were compiling this report. The CIA has called the charge bogus, and has alleged that some of the committee's results came from documents it stole from the agency.

The California senator hopes the first portions of the report will be available to the public within 30 days.

""It is now abundantly clear that, in an effort to prevent further terrorist attacks after 9/11 and bring those responsible to justice, the CIA made serious mistakes(Opens in a new window) that haunt us to this day,"" Feinstein said.

7011973,Sony Backs Ad-Supported Streaming With Exclusive Content for Crackle,"Crackle, the free streaming video platform backed by Sony Pictures Entertainment, has signed a deal with NBCUniversal for the exclusive rights to more than 140 movies over the next three years.

The agreement will mean that a variety of movies such as Ray, Jarhead and the remake of King Kong will not appear on other ad-supported distributors including television channels.

[seealso slug=http://mashable.com/2014/04/02/amazon-fire-tv-competition/]

Sony's investment in Crackle and its willingness to spend the money to acquire exclusive rights to content indicate a willingness to go against the grain of other streaming sites like Netflix and Hulu, which work primarily on subscription models.

This makes Crackle something of a hybrid, operating as a streaming service but making deals like a television channel.

""We acquire content like a true network,"" said Philip Lynch, senior vice president of digital networks and games for Sony Pictures Television. ""We license this content. We're not like a Hulu or a YouTube, which give revenue shares.""

The acquisition of exclusive rights provides Crackle with what it hopes will be content that draws viewers.

""In order for us to build a brand and makes this a destination for consumers to go watch films, we're going to have to have exclusive rights from a customer acquisition standpoint to get them on the service,"" Lynch said.

Since it is entirely supported by ads, Crackle's strategy is to appear on as many platforms as possible. The streaming channel is now on 27 different devices including gaming consoles, streaming set-top boxes and connected televisions.

""The traditional world goes and does the [subscription] fees and we're 100 percent ad supported,"" Lynch said. ""We try to make that up by ubiquitous distribution.""

Reliance on ads means a reliance on viewers. Crackle has had its struggles, recently shutting down in the UK(Opens in a new window).

Crackle was formerly known as Grouper, which Sony bought in 2006 for $65 million. Its original iteration placed it in competition with YouTube(Opens in a new window) more than streamers like Netflix. Sony decided to rebrand it as Crackle in 2007 as a streaming and movie TV library.

7011914,7 Ways to Be a Hero in 'Titanfall',"Titanfall is the Xbox Oneâ€™s first big hit, and thatâ€™s because itâ€™s not like other shooters. Several unique spins on the genre like building-scaling parkour and building-crushing giant robots give it a different flow and demand that you learn some new skills to excel.

If youâ€™re looking to be just as heroic in Titanfall as you might have been in other shooters, youâ€™ll have to learn a few new tricks. Here are some of the top techniques for improving your game and helping your team drive the enemy pilots and Titans into retreat.

1. Don't always summon your Titan

""Titan"" is right in the name, so given the choice, piloting your giant, robotic Titan is always the way to go, right? Wrong. Titans have weaknesses. They donâ€™t have access to as many map objectives, they're less mobile than a skilled pilot, they have difficulty escaping hairy situations, and itâ€™s easy to accidentally deploy them in vulnerable spots.

Sometimes you're better off staying out of the big honking machine. Only summon your Titan if youâ€™re certain that itâ€™s going to give you the edge in that particular moment, and only do it when it wonâ€™t end up surrounded right off the bat. Remember you can spawn into your Titan after you die, too. You don't have to do a risky field deployment.

2. Stick to the AI until you're confident

Titanfall is newbie-friendly in a lot of cool ways. Itâ€™s easy to play Call of Duty: Ghosts or Battlefield 4 and feel like you're just dying over and over without accomplishing anything. Thankfully, Titanfall mixes it up with AI cannon fodder that are easy pickings for newbies. Practice your skills on the mindless minions and avoid enemy players if you feel youâ€™re outclassed. Each minion killed still contributes to your teamâ€™s objective in Attrition mode.

3. Use the Smart Pistol if you're new to shooters

Likewise, Titanfall has a weapon that helps players who haven't put a hundred hours into practicing lightning-quick, razor-sharp aiming. The smart pistol takes a few seconds to lock on, but it'll hit any target in your field of view automatically. Use it to brush up on pure tactics and mobility while your accuracy is still in development.

4. Wallrun to keep your speed up

Itâ€™s faster to run on walls and leap through the air in Titanfall than it is to run on the ground. Trust us: it's science. It takes some practice to keep your momentum leaping from one building to the next â€” it's almost a game in itself. It's worth it, though. Once you master the parkour techniques and learn the best routes, youâ€™ll be able to cross most maps in just a few seconds. That's a huge advantage over the poor saps slugging their way through the mud below.

5. Play the Titan defensively

Titans are powerful machines; they can tear through AI minions and pilots on foot like a chainsaw through paper. Other Titans? Less so.

These towering hunks of metal need to be aware of cover and the angles that expose them to danger just as much as infantry do. In fact, because Titans don't have the speedy parkour escape techniques pilots have, it's even more important to stay aware.

Donâ€™t move out ahead of the pack if youâ€™re fighting with fellow Titans. You simply canâ€™t win if youâ€™re outnumbered. Hang back and position yourself so that you can always dash out of view of your enemies if the tide turns against you.

Credit: EA/Respawn

6. As a pilot, only attack a Titan if it's busy

If you're on foot and a Titan can see you for more than two or three seconds, you will die. Youâ€™re severely outgunned. So don't let that happen.

Take it a step further and don't attack a Titan unless it's too busy to retaliate. Remember that when you shoot an enemy, he or she gets a direction indicator on his or her screen that shows where the fire is coming from. Most players will turn that way and fight back.

Approach it like youâ€™re a pickpocket: Make your move when the target is so overwhelmed by other goings on that he or she won't even have the mental bandwidth to register what you're doing.

7. Make sure you can see more places than can see you

We've saved this one for last because it's classic good sense for shooters. It's just as true in Titanfall as it's ever been. Much of what separates the pros from the newbies is spatial awareness. At any given moment, think about how much of the battlefield you can see and shoot, and contrast that with what portion of the battlefield can see and shoot you. If the latter is a bigger set than the former, change positions because the odds are not in your favor. This alone will improve a new player's game significantly.",4/3/2014 0:00,0.484906,7,3,1,4.649156,4,Social Media,1641.75,3899.178,2915.311,1929.5,0.453441,0.147815,0.052533,0.015009,0.533333,0.316667,1800

7011830,Ukraine Authorities Say Ousted President Masterminded Kiev Sniper Killings,"KIEV, Ukraine -- Ukrainian authorities on Thursday accused deposed President Viktor Yanukovych of conspiring with security officials in February to carry out an unlawful anti-terrorist operation that resulted in elite riot police under their command shooting and killing several anti-government protesters in central Kiev in February.

They also said Yanukovych had used kidnappers and gangs of â€œtitushkiâ€ -- hired thugs -- to intimidate the protesters and quell mass rallies held in the cityâ€™s Independence Square since last November, when Yanukovych spurned a long-anticipated association deal with the European Union, setting the events in motion.

Ukraineâ€™s interior minister, security service chief and general prosecutor presented the findings at a joint press conference in Kiev on Thursday. Prosecutor General Oleh Makhnitsky said 12 members of the riot police units, who are believed to have shot and killed protesters, had been detained. That includes their leader, who allegedly handed out high-powered weapons, such as sniper and Kalashnikov rifles, for use against the protesters.

But Interior Minister Arsen Avakov said others under investigation had fled to Crimea, the Black Sea peninsula seized and annexed by Russia in March. Seventeen protesters were killed by employees of the special police forces operating at Institutska Street, according to Avakov. Eight people were killed from the same machine gun, he added.

â€œThe former government of the country gave criminal orders and a huge number of people suffered in this meat mincer,â€ Avakov said.

Security Service of Ukraine Chief Valentyn Nalyvaichenko said Yanukovych is to blame for the killings of more than 100 people, hailed as heroes and dubbed â€œThe Heavenly Hundredâ€ by protesters.

â€œThe planned anti-terrorist operation, and in fact the organization of mass killings of people, was directly led by former President Yanukovych,â€ he said.

Nalyvaichenko also said 26 members of Russiaâ€™s Federal Security Service (FSB) participated in planning and implementing the anti-terrorist operation and had been at the premises of the Security Service of Ukraine ahead of the operation, but came up short in showing evidence to support the claims.

â€œWe have reasonable grounds to believe that these groups, who were on one of the SBU firing grounds, participated in planning and implementing measures on the so-called anti-terrorist operation,â€ he said at the joint briefing on Thursday.

Russiaâ€™s FSB, however, said it had not been involved in anti-terrorism operation, according to Russian state news agency RIA Novosti. â€œLet those statements remain on the conscience of the Ukrainian Security Services,â€ the news agency cited the security agency as saying.

In what was the countryâ€™s bloodiest day in its post-Soviet history, shots rang out just after 9 a.m. and continued until midday at central Institutska Street in Kiev as protesters clashed with police on Feb. 20. By sundown, more than 100 people had been killed, including several who were gunned down by members of elite squads within the Security Service of Ukraineâ€™s Berkut riot police known as â€œBlack Companyâ€ and â€œAlpha.â€

Dozens of the protesters were shot in the head, heart and lungs, clear signs that they were targeted by expert marksmen, Dr. Olha Bohomolets, who treated several gunshot victims at the nearby Hotel Ukraine on Feb. 20, told Mashable at the time.

The video below, which Ukraine's Interior Ministry released on Thursday, was filmed on Feb. 20. It shows the special police units firing at protesters.

The killings led to the downfall of Yanukovych, who hastily fled his palatial estate outside Kiev under the cover of darkness late on Feb. 21, popping up later in Russiaâ€™s southern Rostov-on-Don. He has been charged and is wanted for mass murder in connection with the protester deaths.

In an interview there with the Associated Press and the Russian state television channel NTV on Thursday, Yanukovych said he had â€œnever given any kinds of order for any shooting.â€",4/3/2014 0:00,0.736434,1,0,2,4.625954,3,Business,2350,3573.086,3087.828,2900,0.49161,0.207483,0.030534,0.022901,0,0,1000
7031739,Ukraine to Get Its Own Social Network -- Once the DDoS Attacks Stop,"Ukraine may soon get its very own social network, Mashable has learned, but its debut is being delayed by ongoing DDoS attacks.

The social network, which will live at WeUA.info(Opens in a new window) (slogan: ""We live for Ukraine), was scheduled to go live Monday night, but has not been able to launch due to a sustained attempt to keep it offline.

""We have not opened the website for the public yet, although we are already seeing very strong DDoS attacks,"" WeUA's founder, Bogdan Oliyarchuk, told Mashable via email. ""We see deliberate attacks every day.""

Oliyarchuk added that while it is difficult to track where the attacks are coming from, he has information that suggests the attacks are coming from Russia -- and elsewhere in Ukraine.

A screenshot of WeUA.info shows a message to users warning about ongoing DDoS attacks. It reads, according to an online translation service: Credit: weua.info

It's events like these that inspired Oliyarchuk to develop WeUA, get it out of beta and into the hands of everyday Ukrainians. He said his team has been hard at work for more than a year, building a social network that will bring Ukrainians together.

""A year ago, we came up with an idea to [connect] Ukrainians all over the world. There are enough talented Ukrainian programmers who can implement this. We have a number of talented people who work abroad in Facebook, in Google, so it got me wondering -- why not make a social network in Ukraine?"" Oliyarchuk said. ""So we tried and launched the beta version with 1,000 people having subscribed, which made us realize we had to hire people to work on a more serious version of the website.""

""It's not just for Ukrainians,"" he continued. ""We hope to become a democratic social network. We have very challenging objectives and ambitious goals."" One of those goals is to introduce an encryption system, so no one can get access to their users' messages.

The region's recent events -- most notably Russia's sudden annexation of Crimea -- have given the team a renewed purpose, heightening the need for a website for Ukrainians, by Ukrainians and an alternative to the Russian-owned VKontakte.com; the site has been identified as a source of several identity leaks over the past few months, Oliyarchuk said. He's even helped coordinate a boycott(Opens in a new window) of Russian-owned social networking websites, asking users to delete their pages, leaving only the message, ""We are Ukrainian. We are WeUA.info.""

""We even thought of placing our servers abroad because of the previous government. Now we have a new government, although some of the servers are still abroad,"" Oliyarchuk said.

Now, they're fighting to keep those servers online. The team expects to launch Thursday, and they're hiring for more help.

7031534,Americans Have World Cup Fever. The Only Prescription Is More Tickets.,"Americans officially have World Cup fever -- and the only prescription, it seems, is more tickets. The United States Men's National Team should have more supporters, by a vast margin, than any country other than host Brazil at the World Cup this summer, according to ticket sales data released this week.

FIFA, world soccer's governing body, said a total of 1,591,435 World Cup tickets have been sold to fans so far. Brazilians get 65% of those tickets, while international fans can buy the remaining 35%. The top four international countries for ticket sales are the United States, Australia, England and Colombia. But just how far ahead the U.S. is may surprise you.

[seealso url = ""http://mashable.com/2014/03/30/world-cup-usmnt-mls-players""]

Here are the top five ticket-buying nations so far, according to FIFA data released on Tuesday(Opens in a new window):

Brazil: 1,041,418 tickets bought so far

USA: 154,412 tickets bought so far

Australia: 40,681 tickets bought so far

England: 38,043 tickets bought so far

Colombia: 33,126 tickets bought so far

Argentina, Germany, Canada, Chile and France round out the top 10, FIFA tells Mashable. Tickets have also been bought from more far-flung locations including Vatican City, Palestine, Albania, Botswana, Eritrea, Seychelles, the Falkland Islands and Swaziland.

The U.S. also performed strongly for ticket sales ahead of the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. As Deadspin(Opens in a new window) pointed out, the U.S. is the most populous country in the 2014 World Cup, so this should be expected to a certain extent. But for a country where soccer is rapidly growing in popularity after decades of national apathy surrounding the sport, this is still pretty cool to see.

Tickets go on sale again in a ""last minute"" phase beginning April 15. They aren't cheap, though; the face value of a ""Category 1"" ticket in a desirable seating location for a group-play match is $175.

For many, however, that's money well spent.

The two were traveling in their own car with a convoy of election workers delivering ballots from the center of Khost city to the outskirts of Tani district. The convoy was protected by Afghan forces when the police opened fire on the car, which also held a translator and driver.

Niedringhaus was an internationally acclaimed German photographer who has covered conflict zones in Kuwait, Iraq, Gaza, Libya and the West Bank. She had traveled to Afghanistan numerous times since the 2001 U.S.-led invasion, and was covering the upcoming presidential elections in Afghanistan slated to take place on April 5.

AP Vice President and Director of Photography Santiago Lyon, who has known and worked with Niedringhaus for 22 years, sent the following statement to Mashable:

Anja was one of the most talented, bravest and accomplished photojournalists of her generation.

Her storytelling skill with a camera was extraordinarily effective, a reflection of her own open gaze and genuine compassion for her subjects.

Her enthusiasm and good cheer were infectious, even in the darkest of circumstances. She consistently volunteered for the hardest assignments and was remarkably resilient in carrying them out time after time. She truly believed in the need to bear witness.

Niedringhaus leaves behind a portfolio of poignant and telling photographs that gave viewers a glimpse into daily life in conflict zones worldwide. Her attention to composition and light came together not only to tell insightful stories, but also to create stunning works of art.

The most recent saga of censorship in Turkey started on March 20, when Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip ErdoÄŸan pledged to ""eradicate"" Twitter and blocked access to it.

7031602,How to Cope With Information Overload,"Information overload has become an everyday experience for anyone who works with computers, owns a smartphone or waits at a bus stop with minute-by-minute updates about arrival times.

And this information overload has been cited as a major factor in the rise of stress-related diseases(Opens in a new window). Some advocate a digital detox(Opens in a new window) as the antidote to the curse of email, social media and constant communication but for many, that is just isn't practical.

Others are turning to traditional mindfulness meditation techniques as a way of managing their digital dependence without having to switch off from their everyday lives entirely. It's seen as a way to calm the mind and help the body to cope with the overwhelming amount of data coming our way from all different directions and sources.

As long ago as June 1983 Time magazine ran a cover feature on stress as a modern anxiety(Opens in a new window). Three decades later, answers to the problem are being put forward by that same magazine. A February 2014 issue of Time featured a cover that read: The mindful revolution: The science of finding focus in a stressed-out, multitasking culture(Opens in a new window).

In 2014, Time readers, like many others, want practical solutions to their stress. We answer work emails while waiting in a supermarket line, we pay bills while preparing dinner and we follow our favorite celebrity's tweets while we eat it. We can begin to feel like we couldn't escape all the stimuli even if we wanted to.

Answer your work email on the weekend often enough and you can feel like it's expected of you to do so all the time. Once you are used to receiving a constant stream of news, you start to feel lost without it. That can cause anxiety and depression.

Managing mindfully

Mindfulness has been described as(Opens in a new window) ""a moment-to-moment attention to present experience with a stance of open curiosity."" It's our ability to deliberately become more aware of the present moment and less caught up in our regrets for the past or anxiety for the future.

Mindfulness has been studied extensively in the medical domain as a potential tool in managing a number of conditions such as anxiety(Opens in a new window) and help with recovery from illness(Opens in a new window).

Mindfulness is using the brain's ability to change and became stronger when trained accordingly, an ability called neuroplasticity(Opens in a new window), which is comparable to a muscle changing as a result of physical exercise. Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction(Opens in a new window) is a training program developed by Jon-Kabat-Zinn at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center that draws on this trait and aims to complement medical treatment for chronic pain and stress related disorders.

Then there is the use of mindfulness as a business tool. Mindful leadership, for example, is often viewed as a way to help individuals and organizations to be successful while also being kind and thoughtful. The search inside yourself(Opens in a new window) program developed by Google's Chade-Meng Tan, is an example. Tan urges people who take his course to cultivate emotional awareness(Opens in a new window) as a way to handle the stresses of work. The trend has spread and mindfulness meditation has been common practice at companies across Silicon Valley(Opens in a new window).

Your daily dose of mindful

Away from Silicon Valley, there are small steps we can take to bring mindfulness to our digital lives. Email is a good place to start. It is believed that most people overindulge in mindless emailing as it is considered a quick and convenient way to communicate.

In a study(Opens in a new window) conducted by the University of Glasgow and Modeuro Consulting, executives at the utility company London Power were asked to be more mindful about the emails they send to staff and to think twice every time they were about to hit the send button. As a result, email around the office was reduced by half during the study, leading the researchers to conclude that the company could save 11,000 working hours a year as a result.

Mindful emailing includes practices such as taking three breaths before responding to a stressful email and also considering the psychological effect that the email will have to the recipient or recipients.

Social media, which feeds our desire for constant information sharing, is another practice that, when done mindfully, can become a fruitful social interaction rather than a mindless disruption.

Mindful use of social media(Opens in a new window) includes checking our intentions before uploading a feed, being authentic in our communications and choosing the time we spend on social media rather than falling in to it. That way, we give it some of our spare time rather than allowing it to creep around the fringes of our whole life, potentially disrupting us at any time.

These are all relatively small steps but rely on the user of a technology to pause for thought as they go. It's a simple technique that many think has had significant results in a variety of contexts. We've been coping with our very modern malady for decades, perhaps we are finally making some progress.

7011587,"The Future of Fashion Is Code, Not Couture, Says Designer","Designer Francis Bitonti's Brooklyn studio is an airy space filled with dress forms and lacquered desks piled with books. At first, it looks every bit the traditional atelier. But then you notice a cluster of MakerBots, each glowing purple and constantly printing, fed by spools of filament. Intricate 3D-printed models cover the tables: bowls that look like branches, sculptures like ice crystals, tiny, gemlike cubes.

This is the future of fashion, according to Bitonti. 3D printers are giving way to a new aesthetic in haute couture: algorithmic garments and accessories that proudly display their origins in tech.

""Technology redefines material as information, as data,"" Bitonti says. With 3D printers in homes, ""consumers are becoming producers.""

[seealso slug=""youtube-beauty""]

Bitonti's Cloud Collection(Opens in a new window) debuts Friday, April 4. The capsule collection offers four decorative housewares, or rather, the code for these items. By modifying one aspect of the code, consumers can decide how much noise or relief appears on the surface of a vase or bowl, resulting in a customized purchase.

The Cloud Collection is aimed at the masses. Consumers can download the code for $1, but non-MakerBot owners must pay extra to print from 3D Hubs(Opens in a new window), which have partnered with Bitonti for the line. ""We tried to make something where the consumer could engage in the narrative of the object and be part of the design, but not necessarily have to become the designer,"" Bitonti says.

The result of code as couture is visually stunning: delicate architectures that couldn't be made by hand or even injection-molded out of plastic.

Bitonti's most famous project is the Swarovski crystal-encrusted, 3D-printed gown(Opens in a new window) that debuted on curvaceous burlesque icon Dita von Teese in March 2013, in collaboration with costume designer Michael Schmidt and 3D printing market Shapeways(Opens in a new window). Bitonti has since constructed the Bristle Dress(Opens in a new window) and the Verlan Dress(Opens in a new window), two sculptural garments printed with MakerBot's flexible filament, which fall somewhere between designer duds and architectural marvels.

In concert with the Cloud Collection, Bitonti is releasing a line of haute couture accessories that merge traditional textiles with 3D-printed embellishments. The strategy incorporates materials that technology can't yet print. ""It's kind of trying to create a hyper-luxury, or a post-human luxury, that will take us beyond our own capabilities,"" he says.

Bitonti envisions 3D-printed couture branching off into two enterprises: the mass-production model, where any consumer can become a maker at a low cost, and the luxury model, where high-end garments are created using 3D printing processes, in addition to luxury materials. He predicts code will compete alongside couture for the fashion industry's profits, just as an album is now sold on iTunes instead of as a physical object.

But he might be a little too ahead of the curve, says Liz Bacelar, founder of fashion technology incubator Decoded Fashion(Opens in a new window). For fashion designers, she explains, the design process doesn't end with the sketch -- which, in 3D printing terms, could be compared to the code.

Left, model Ica Paru sports the Bristle Dress, which was printed on a MakerBot. Right, a model wears the 'Winter Froze You Away' belt, designed by Bitonti. Credit: Chris Vongsawat, Dan Lecca

""Selling code is not something that sounds inviting to designers,"" she says. ""It's like you're selling the sketch but letting go of how it's produced. Designers spend so much time selecting the right material, deciding how it's going to be stitched, how it's going to be cut. To let that all go is incredibly scary."" By selling code rather than a finished garment, Bacelar says, ""you're pretty much [reducing] an artist like Zac Posen to a sketch artist.""

Still, Bacelar agrees that code will become a part of the fashion industry's DNA. As materials improve, she says, the market for 3D-printed couture will only expand. She predicts we'll have to wait another three years before 3D printing materials will take on the look and feel of fabric; Bitonti gave Mashable a similar estimate.

""With 3D printing,"" Bacelar says, ""I've never seen something that is so inspiring and so scary at the same time.""",4/4/2014 0:00,0.517333,9,11,0,4.912467,8,00000,764,5988.347,3262.356,1100,0.359848,0.102462,0.02122,0.013263,0,0,1600

7031398,Google Tries to Trademark 'Glass',"King tried to trademark ""Candy,"" Apple tried to trademark ""app store"" and now Google is trying to trademark ""Glass.""

The tech giant wants the trademark, of course, for its Google Glass eyewear. It already has the trademark for ""Google Glass,"" but is seeking an additional trademark for the word ""Glass"" by itself, styled in the futuristic font Google uses in its packaging and marketing.

According to The Wall Street Journal(Opens in a new window), however, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) is putting a kink in the company's plans. The Journal posted a letter(Opens in a new window) [PDF] from the USPTO to Google, which outlines some of the problems the office has with the request.

[img src=""http://admin.mashable.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Screen-Shot-2014-04-04-at-12.50.49-PM-640x234.png"" caption=""This is the stylized version fo ""Glass"" Google wants to trademark."" credit=""Google"" alt=""Glass Logo""]

The first issue is that the Glass trademark might be too similar to other glass trademarks or pending trademarks since, as it turns out, Google's not the first company to apply for a glass trademark. It's not even the first computer software/hardware related glass trademark application on file. The letter from the USPTO includes various approved or pending applications for design marks such as ""glass,"" ""looking glass,"" ""iGlass,"" ""smartglass"" and ""teleglass.""

The second issue is that even if Google got a trademark on Glass -- distinctive font and all -- the USPTO doesn't think glass is a term that can be trademarked under federal law, which says that you can't trademark words that describe a product. It also sees ""glass"" as ""merely descriptive.""

Naturally, Google disagrees. The company reportedly filed a response to the USPTO arguing that a Google trademark of Glass would not be confusing because of how much publicity surrounds the Google Glass product.

Google also takes issue with the idea that Glass is descriptive, because Google Glass itself doesn't actually contain any physical glass.

Going over the head, the Galaxy S5 was next to go, suffering a fatal screen crack while the HTC One kept on ticking. Only when the HTC fell from an unlikely 10-foot drop did it, too, get smashed.

Does this mean the HTC One M8 gets bragging rights as the hardiest device you can buy? Not necessarily -- after all, as the tester notes, there was no way to ensure the phones all fell the same way. But the One, with its solid metal casing may have a slight advantage over its rivals.

In any case, these tests are fun to watch.

7031366,Human Rights Groups Call for End to Surveillance Tech That 'Crushes Dissent',"A group of major human rights organizations has launched a new initiative to end the proliferation of surveillance technology, which western companies have been accused of selling to governments around the world.

On Friday, Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, Privacy International, Reporters Without Borders and others launched a coalition dubbed CAUSE(Opens in a new window) (Coalition Against Unlawful Surveillance Exports), to promote new regulations and restrictions on the distribution of spy technology, which activists define as ""digital arms(Opens in a new window).""

SEE ALSO: This Is How the NSA Is Trying to Win Over the Media

The spyware tools are typically marketed for law enforcement use but, in many cases, the countries that purchase them have been accused of abusing them for nefarious purposes. Cyber sleuths have uncovered numerous cases of political dissidents, citizen journalists or human rights advocates being targeted and spied on by governments using law enforcement software or monitoring gear sold by European or American companies.

""Western technology could immediately be traced back to individuals who had been dragged from their homes and put into prison,"" Marietje Schaake, a European Parliament Member who has been advocating for export controls on surveillance technology for years, said(Opens in a new window) at a recent event in Washington, D.C.

The surveillance technology market was worth $5 billion dollars a year, according to The Wall Street Journal(Opens in a new window), and there are very few regulations that limit it.

This kind of technology could theoretically allow a government to hijack a target's computer, steal her personal information, spy on her through the laptop's webcam, and record Skype conversations, among other capabilities.

In February, researchers accused the government of Ethiopia of using spyware made by the Italian firm Hacking Team to target Ethiopians in the diaspora. Hacking Team's software was later found in 21 countries, including some with dubious human rights records such as Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Saudi Arabia, or Sudan.

In the past few years, there have been many similar cases.

In 2011, it was revealed that French company Amesys had provided(Opens in a new window) surveillance technology to Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi. The government of the United Arab Emirates, for its part, has reportedly used spyware(Opens in a new window) made by German company FinFisher to target the pro-democracy activist Ahmed Mansoor.

""These technologies enable regimes to crush dissent or criticism, chill free speech and destroy the fundamental rights that underpin democratic societies,"" the organizations said in an open letter published on the CAUSE website.

The organizers want this uncontrolled proliferation to stop, and they think the best way to do that is to regulate the sale of spy technology through export controls.

In 2013, a group of 41 countries including the United States, Germany, the UK, and France agreed to update the weapons export controls framework known as the Wassenaar Arangement to include new limitations on exporting ""intrusion software"" and ""IP network surveillance systems.""

Supporters of export controls saw that as a ""first step(Opens in a new window)"" in the right direction. But now, they say, countries that are part of the agreement need to incorporate these regulations into their internal legal regime to make it really effective.

Export controls would force a company selling these products to be required to ask its own government for a license before selling to a certain country. In the United States, for example, before exporting weapons or so-called dual-use items (which have both military and civilian uses), a company has to check if the item that it is trying to sell is controlled.

If it is, it needs permission, ""giving the U.S. government the ability to approve or deny the application based on a number of factors, including the destination and end-use,"" as Danielle Kehl and Robert Morgus, researchers at New America's Open Technology Institute, explained in Slate(Opens in a new window).

But some fear that export controls on hard-to-define software products might end up preventing legitimate and useful products from reaching people in need.

A hacker and security researcher that goes by the name of Fukami pointed to the example of a group of Germans who wanted to send encrypted phones to Ukraine during the unrest in the country, to help protesters protect their communications.

""Since it takes a while to get the proper papers for that, the people in Ukraine simply didn't get those phones,"" he said at a panel on export controls(Opens in a new window) at the human rights and technology conference RightsCon in March.

But proponents of stronger regulations against surveillance technology recognize the importance of ""smart and targeted"" regulation.

""Export controls are not alone enough, and absolutely must ensure that technology with legitimate purposes are not wrongly ensnared,"" Mike Rispoli, a spokesperson for Privacy International, told Mashable.",4/4/2014 0:00,0.523973,43,1,0,4.712446,6,Entertainment,1980,4419.579,3279.095,2850,0.583701,0.075251,0.035408,0.033262,0.6,-0.3,1300
7031396,Binding Books in Human Skin Used To Be 'Somewhat Common',"You think Twitter is weird(Opens in a new window)? Look at early print culture and the practice of what book historians call anthropodermic bibliopegy. That would be binding books in human skin.

And while many of you now find the notion grotesque, the people of the 17th or 19th century would not have, apparently.

""While books bound in human skin are now objects of fascination and revulsion, the practice was once somewhat common,"" writes Heather Cole(Opens in a new window), assistant curator of modern books and manuscripts at Harvard's Houghton Library. ""Termed anthropodermic bibliopegy, the binding of books in human skin has occurred at least since the 16th century. The confessions of criminals were occasionally bound in the skin of the convicted, or an individual might request to be memorialized for family or lovers in the form of a book.""

Houghton, where Cole works, has one such books in its collection which is, putatively though not definitively, bound in skin.

A recent article in JAMA Dermatology featured a short examination of the book, along with a rousing call for greater study of books bound in human skin. The title was: ""Anthropodermic Bibliopegy: From a Different Sort of Dermatologic Text(Opens in a new window).""

""On examination of the bookbinding, numerous follicular ostia are clearly visible and provide a raised, coarse texture to the front and back covers,"" Harvard dermatologist Vinod Nambudiri writes. ""The pages are gilt-edged. The bookbinding has an even, golden-brown background hue. Focal areas of darker brown pigmentation likely reflect variation in the literal 'skin tanning' process underlying the binding's production and consequences of handling over the book's existence rather than melanocytic proliferations in the native skin based on examination with epiluminescence microscopy.""

This is a look at the book in question: ""Des destinees de l'ame,"" by ArsÃ¨ne Houssaye.

Credit: Houghton Library

And one can imagine a curious dermatologist would want to know precisely how the skin might hold up. Nambudiri further notes that the books ""serve as reminders of the versatility of the body's largest organ -- both during life and beyond."" He also says they ""represent an elite class of dermatologic texts which deserve further study, cover to cover.""

These works need ""detailed analysis of preserved parameters such as follicle density, follicular diameter, and pigmentary patterns.""

And it may be that further testing may prove that they are not, in fact, bound with human skin. For example, a book at the Harvard Law School bore this inscription:

The bynding of this booke is all that remains of my dear friende Jonas Wright, who was flayed alive by the Wavuma on the Fourth Day of August, 1632. King Mbesa did give me the book, it being one of poore Jonas chiefe possessions, together with ample of his skin to bynd it. Requiescat in pace.

7011468,United Nations Simulates Violent Land Mines via Apple iBeacons,"I made it only two steps before I detonated a land mine. The explosion ripped through my ears as my heart pounded. Were this a real land mine, a recording informed me, my hands would be torn apart. Shrapnel would fly at my face, blinding me. Without swift medical attention, I would die.

But none of this actually happened. The minefield I walked through was only virtual. I was on the top floor of New York's New Museum, overlooking a sea of silent Manhattan rooftops, far from the conflict zones where this sort of horror is a reality.

Within five minutes of the simulation, I detonated three more land mines.

[seealso slug=""innovations-world-2013""]

Digital marketing agency Critical Mass(Opens in a new window) organized this land mine simulation, called ""Sweeper,"" which debuted in New York on Friday, in conjunction with the United Nations Mine Action Service(Opens in a new window). It communicates the terrifying threat of land mines throughout the world, despite a 1999 worldwide ban on anti-personnel mines. ""Sweeper"" simulates the very real terror of leaving home, walking to school or driving to work, and not knowing if you'll survive your next step.

According to UNMAS, at least 10 people are killed or injured by land mines each day, and their presence is enough to cripple entire communities. UNMAS works to disable mines and train local teams to do the same. A report from the organization indicates its explosive-clearing programs, comprising 17 countries in 2012, have disabled and destroyed 1.15 million explosive devices.

""We don't have to live with this,"" said AgnÃ¨s Marcaillou, director of UNMAS. ""We cross the street, we walk around, kids are playing soccer. But it's not the case everywhere. Remember that every time you see an image of a conflict on TV, whether it is the South Sudan, Somalia, Syria -- these countries are affected, contaminated [by explosives].""

Using Apple's iBeacon technology, which harnesses Bluetooth Low Energy and geofencing to provide micro-location awareness between apps, UNMAS was able to plant invisible, simulated land mines around the exhibit space. Inside the organization's app, also called Sweeper(Opens in a new window), a land mine ""explodes"" when an unlucky individual comes across one. A recording then explains the physical injury inflicted by each type of mine: Bouncing Betty, PRB M3, VS50 -- all gruesome, most deadly.

""There is a Japanese saying: To hear about [a conflict] 100 times is less impactful than to actually see it one time,"" said UN Japanese ambassador Kazuyoski Umemoto. ""In Washington, we don't have to see it. We don't have to experience it. But this exhibition will give us some idea what those dangers are.""

UNMAS organized ""Sweeper"" in conjunction with digital marketing agency Critical Mass(Opens in a new window) in honor of the International Day for Mine Awareness and Assistance in Mine Action(Opens in a new window), on April 4. The United Nations General Assembly established the organization in 1997 to assess and neutralize the threats of mines, unexploded ordnance, unsafe munitions depots, cluster bombs and improvised explosive devices in areas of conflict around the world, which injure and kill thousands of people worldwide every year.

These efforts not only help bring stability to communities, they improve peacekeepers and humanitarian organizations' ability to deliver aid to nations in need, Marcaillou added. But to do so, UNMAS needs funding to purchase equipment, demine regions and educate communities.

Marcaillou tells Mashable she hopes the exhibit will shed light on what ""contamination"" really means in the context of explosives. ""Conflicts leave contamination in a country, and this contamination lasts forever,"" she says. ""When displaced people return home after the peace process is over, if they return to contaminated schools, homes and hospitals, the bloodbath will continue.""

7031374,"David Letterman May Have Lost Some Battles, But He Won the Late-Night Wars","Sure, David Letterman lost some battles along the way.

He waited out Johnny Carson in vain. Ceded ratings supremacy to Jay Leno. Endured embarrassing personal entanglements (stalking, blackmail), made some missteps (inappropriate workplace relationships) and faced real peril (emergency open heart surgery), all while remaining fiercely private.

In spite of it all, Letterman outlasted a lot of lesser late-night lights to become the longest-running host on network TV. Heâ€™ll have some 33 years behind the desk by the time he retires next year, a few more than even Carson logged in his own legendary run.

During Daveâ€™s time, Conan Oâ€™Brien came and went from network TV. Arsenio Hall, too -- twice. Remember Dennis Miller? George Lopez? Whoopi Goldberg? Even Chevy Chase and Pat Sajak had a trip to the plate. Pat Sajak! We take for granted how fickle is the late-night game; how difficult it is to stick.

And all those young talents taking their swings now -- Jimmy Fallon, Jimmy Kimmel, Seth Meyers. Dave hung around long enough to see each of them essentially cast in his mold.

Yeah, Letterman lost some battles. But theyâ€™ve always called this late-night â€œwarsâ€ for a reason.

Dave won the war. Now heâ€™ll take a victory lap to prove it.

Funny thing is, Letterman is about to turn 67, but he always was, and always will be, the mischievous one. The anti-establishment one. The irreverent kid in a world of stuffy grownups.

He reinvented our understanding of funny with that insouciant streak, hurling objects off his building and leaping onto a Velcro wall wearing a Velcro suit for no reason. Because it was his show and he could. Carson did silly, sure, but nothing as random as that.

Iâ€™d go so far as to say Letterman made â€œrandomâ€ its own brand of funny. It was his thing for a good long while, until it became mainstream in the late â€˜90s. That's so random, the kids still say. Almost sounds quaint now, doesnâ€™t it?

But there was always something questioning and cerebral going on beneath the surface; some need for a deeper understanding. For that reason, not everything he tried necessarily worked. (Remember â€œUma, Oprahâ€? That was so random!)

Leno liked to tell jokes and serve up softballs to his guests, but did he ever take a real risk for a laugh? Dave was punk rock to Lenoâ€™s easy listening; if heâ€™d won the ratings, it wouldnâ€™t have been right, anyway.

Letterman put self-deprecation in Conanâ€™s back pocket. He made it OK for Jimmy Kimmel to be crass and biting, a consistent risk-taker. Invented Fallonâ€™s ""itâ€™s-just-you-and-me-having-fun"" interview trick. And every time Meyers looks into the camera and makes that are you kidding me face? Pure Dave.

Letterman isnâ€™t just going out on his own terms. Heâ€™s going out in his own time; an era of late-night -- nay, of comedy at large -- that he created. And itâ€™s still going strong.

The more I think about it, Letterman didnâ€™t just win the late-night wars. He established a comedy superpower in a brand of humor that will live on long after the smoke clears.

7004673,James Franco Responds to Rumored Instagram Flirtation With Teen,"James Franco publicly responded to rumors that he recently tried to pick up a 17-year-old girl using social media.

The rumors, which began circulating Thursday, claim that the actor pursued Lucy Clode, a 17-year-old tourist from Scotland, on Instagram. Clode posted her alleged conversation with the 35-year-old actor online (the conversation's screenshots have been removed from Imgur, as has her Instagram(Opens in a new window) profile).

Franco appeared on Live! With Kelly and Michael on Friday to discuss his actions, saying he's embarrassed.

""I was feeling awkward,"" Franco said. ""I guess I'm just a model of how social media is tricky. It's a way people meet each other today. ... You don't know who's on the other end. ... I used bad judgment and I learned my lesson.""

The timing of the incident is curious -- Franco has an upcoming movie, Palo Alto, in which he plays a soccer coach who begins a romantic relationship with an underage girl (Emma Roberts). The trailer for the film also dropped Friday, just a day after the news of Franco's scandal broke.

The movie is based on a 2010 book of short stories Franco penned with the same title.

Franco's reps did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Franco reportedly met Clode outside of the Broadway theater where he's currently starring in Of Mice and Men. In the video below, which was posted to Clode's Instagram but has since been removed, Franco notices the girl and asks her to tag him.

Clode's images then indicate that Franco began direct messaging her asking her ""You're 18?"" to which she responds ""nearly 18."" The flirting continues, however, and Franco asks how long she is staying in New York, if she would meet him and if he should get a hotel room. He also allegedly provided selfies to prove his identity to her.

The company said on Friday(Opens in a new window) that it had no choice but to shutter its restaurants in the cities of Yalta, Simferopol and Sevastopol due to the ""suspension of necessary financial and banking services,"" presumably a reference to United States-imposed sanctions against Russia that froze certain bank funds.

""Like many other multi-national companies, McDonald's is currently evaluating potential business and regulatory implications which may result from the evolving situation in Crimea,"" the company said in a statement(Opens in a new window) on its website. ""We believe it is prudent and responsible to sort through these details thoroughly.""

Tensions between the U.S. and Russia escalated to the highest point since the Cold War in late March after Russia annexed Crimea, a peninsula that was an autonomous region at the South of Ukraine until Moscow invaded it earlier that month. The U.S. does not recognize that Crimea is controlled by Russia; the U.S. and Russia have issued sanctions against one another including travel bans on high-ranking Russian and American officials.

The U.S. has also locked assets at Bank Rossiya reportedly worth $10 billion. All Americans and American businesses with funds tied to that bank will not have access to them as long as the sanctions remain.

While there was no explicit mention of the political situation in the McDonald's statement, the Russian leader of the Liberal Democrat Party seemed to regard the announcement as a shot at Russia(Opens in a new window). Vladimir Zhirinovsky, whose party backs Russian President Vladimir Putin, declared that all 400-plus McDonald's restaurants in Russia should be shut down or picketed, and threatened that Pepsi may be the next American company to get the boot.

Fortunately for McDonald's, ABC News reports that Moscow doesn't usually pay attention(Opens in a new window) to Zhirinovsky's statements. That said, Crimean First Deputy Prime Minister Rustam Temirgaliyev believes Russian fast food chains will quickly fill the burger-shaped holes in Crimean hearts.

7031292,"I, Cortana: How Microsoft's Answer to Siri Was Born","I've just told my new personal assistant that she sucks. She responds very calmly, telling me that my outburst may result in ""early-onset rampancy"" before giving me the silent treatment.

She's not really my personal assistant, of course, and she doesn't actually suck. Her name is Cortana, Microsoft's new voice-enabled virtual assistant for Windows Phone, and I've been trying to stump her with some offbeat requests.

[seealso slug=""microsoft-2013-milestones""]

Generally, she's been doing OK -- although, like her cousins Siri and Google Now, Cortana will shunt me to a list of search results if she can't figure out what I'm saying. But she often surprises me with spurts of cleverness. Microsoft has clearly prepared her with plenty of semi-sassy statements to amuse users when they decide to have a little fun with her.

And they will. The Microsoft team researched how people were interacting with Windows Phone's current, fairly primitive voice commands. They found that more than 10% was what Microsoft describes as ""chitchat"" -- semi-silly requests like ""tell me a joke"" or ""where are you from?""

The chitchat statistic helped guide Microsoft's overall approach to building Cortana: Creating a service -- perhaps the better word is ""entity"" -- that really gets to know its user, so it doesn't just react to requests. Once she gets to know you, Cortana can anticipate what you'll ask, and serve up information before you even do so.

The human factor

While the chitchat is basically canned answers, it meets an expectation on the user's part: That the assistant should seem at least somewhat human. If Cortana talks to users in a natural, conversational way, they will probably want to talk to her more. Thus, Microsoft dedicated a whole team to creating chitchat answers.

Microsoft also added a brilliant differentiator: people reminders. While iOS and Android can tie reminders to specific times and places, with Cortana, Windows Phone is the only mobile platform that can attach reminders to individuals: ""Remind me to ask Dave about the new house next time I talk to him.""

""People were using standard reminder apps to do things that were associated with a person,"" said Microsoft's Marcus Ash, program manager for the Cortana team. ""The problem is the reminder wouldn't fire when you're actually talking to them. So we thought why not make it fire when you talk to the person.""

But it's the anticipatory philosophy behind Cortana that really makes her tick -- not to mention differentiates her from Siri. Whereas Apple's assistant is centered around voice control and only appears when you call upon her, Cortana is more than just voice. She's looking at your calendar, your contacts and even your email to make connections and serve up information when it makes sense.

For example, if you ask Cortana about the weather every day around the same time, after a few days, she'll suggest telling you the weather at that time, without you even asking. Likewise, if you text someone often, Cortana might ask if that contact should be added to your favorites list (called the ""Inner Circle"").

""What people want is something that has context,"" Ash said. ""Bringing in this proactive 'I can anticipate what you want,' felt like the future to us.""

You can certainly say no, and Microsoft said that Cortana won't look at any of your data you don't want her to. In fact, if you want her to just behave like Siri, with no ""getting to know you"" factor, you can choose that, too.

Avoiding creepiness

Making Cortana's anticipatory features purely opt-in lets Microsoft avoid accusations of hypocrisy in light of its ""Scroogled"" campaign that criticized Google for reading people's emails to customize ads. Now that Microsoft is creating its own services powered by personal data, it's walking a fine line.

""People can be delighted by systems that do things on your behalf, but you have to make sure this stuff isn't creepy,"" Ash said. ""The customer has to feel like they're in control of the system, not the other way around.""

In Cortana's case, it may be worth it. While Google is also dedicating a lot of resources to natural language processing and context-based requests (such as search results that factor in your last search), the result isn't quite as ""personal."" Google Now serves up some great data, but you wouldn't think to ask about its thoughts on Larry Page.

Helping Cortana seem human is the human behind her voice: Jen Taylor(Opens in a new window). Cortana is named after the holographic assistant from the Halo universe, and Taylor has been voicing her since the first game title back in 2001. She does the chitchat answers and key phrases, but because of the sheer amount of recording needed, Taylor's voice is supplemented by others.

""She's going to be the voice of Cortana,"" Ash said. ""She does all the chit-chat now. For other [phrases], it's a hybrid of voices, but we're working with Jen to replace our overall voice.""

Cortana, at least the beta version, will make her debut in Windows Phone 8.1, with an official release later in April. While Microsoft's digital assistant is coming late to the party, its big-picture, personalized approach could be a key long-term differentiator.

""The future is really in a learning system getting so good that it gives you insights about yourself that you don't even realize,"" Ash said. ""That's been our long-term vision.""

It will take years for that vision to be realized, but a device that can offer just the right information by anticipating your needs and knowing your context (sometimes assisted by beacons) is approaching the behavior of a living, breathing personal assistant. Cortana will probably never save the world with Master Chief, but she's definitely a personality the future could fall in love with.",4/4/2014 0:00,0.54417,6,1,0,4.762069,9,00000,1005,3759.263,2480.998,8200,0.42571,0.148225,0.034483,0.013793,0.391667,0.308333,818

7011449,Consumers Win in Cellphone Providers' Price War,"Your mobile-phone bill may finally be shrinking.

The industry's fight over prices, ignited last year by T-Mobile US Inc., is beginning to have a noticeable effect even for consumers who haven't switched carriers. As they jockey to match or beat each other's discounts for new customers, the wireless companies are also passing along savings to their current users to keep them from running off to a competitor.

Even Verizon Communications Inc.(Opens in a new window), the largest U.S. wireless carrier and the one that gets the most revenue per customer, has been dragged into the fray. In the last week, with no formal announcement or fanfare, it matched AT&T's latest price cut for big-spending, family-plan customers -- itself a move to get closer to the $140 a month T-Mobile charges for an equivalent package. While sales are still expanding for mobile carriers, savvy consumers have been able to save hundreds of dollars a year.

""I'm a good example,"" said Roger Entner, an analyst with Recon Analytics in Dedham, Massachusetts(Opens in a new window). ""Last year I was paying $120 a month. I made a switch and now I'm down to $65. I'm getting twice the data at half the price.""

Entner said he didn't have to change carriers to get the price break.

The number of service-plan adjustments, promotions and price cuts has doubled in the first three months of this year compared with the last quarter of 2013, according to Craig Moffett, an analyst at MoffettNathanson Research in New York.

Price Cut

In its latest price cut, Verizon reduced the monthly charge for using a smartphone on a 10-gigabyte service plan to $15 from $20. For a family using four smartphones, that means a monthly plan of $180 just fell to $160 -- in line with discounts AT&T announced in February. Verizon says its promotion is temporary.

""Verizon does not want to fall too far behind AT&T when it comes to their overall pricing -- especially in the 10-gigabyte-plus category, as that is the most valuable sector of customers,"" said Weston Henderek, an analyst with Current Analysis.

While Sprint Corp.(Opens in a new window) introduced ""Framily"" plans this year to stay competitive, it charges $200 a month for an offering equivalent to Verizon's new discount, the highest among the major carriers. Today, the company started(Opens in a new window) a buyout offer of as much as $650 to customers that switch carriers over the next month, matching an incentive T-Mobile introduced earlier this year.

Investors have long prized Verizon for its ability to charge a premium because it has the best network -- a claim backed by recent reports on measures such as reliability, call quality, data and text messaging.

Revenue Rising

""For us, it's giving our customers more value for what they're paying for,"" Verizon Chief Financial Officer Fran Shammo said at an investor conference last month.

So far, the price cuts haven't translated into a decline in the average revenue Verizon gets from each subscription. The average payment rose 7% last year to more than $157 a month. Shammo has said he expects it to keep going up as more customers switch to smartphones and add other devices, such as tablets, to their plans. The discounts may encourage that behavior.

T-Mobile's Lead

T-Mobile led the way in separating the costs of buying devices from the rest of the wireless bill. Its competitors have followed suit, offering phones on installment plans and billing separately for service. This is a bonus for carriers. It relieves them from having to pay hundreds of dollars to offer phones below cost, a strategy that had been used to lure customers into two-year contracts.

Even T-Mobile is loath to use the words ""price war."" It's just ""normal, healthy competition,"" CFO Braxton Carter said in February. Over time, though, the discounts add up and put pressure on the carriers' growth. And price cuts are showing no signs of slowing down.",4/4/2014 0:00,0.346639,30,14,0,5.135233,9,Tech,0,12633.33,3251.234,0,0.538845,0.185362,0.063212,0.018135,0.75,0.5,3500
7011433,Gay Couples May Soon Be Legally Recognized in Ohio,"A federal judge in Cincinnati said Friday he would strike down Ohio's gay marriage recognition ban.

U.S. judge Timothy Black said he would rule the state's ban unconstitutional in a written decision on April 14, adding that the ban, which was implemented in 2004, violates couples' constitutional right to equal protection. If the ban is upheld, Ohio will recognize gay marriages that took place in other states. However, Cincinnati television station WLWT(Opens in a new window) reports that Ohio won't be required to allow same-sex marriages to take place within the state.

The ruling will follow a lawsuit that challenged the constitutionality of Ohio's ban, but state attorneys will have time(Opens in a new window) to appeal the decision; there's a 10-day waiting period between the announcement and the official declaration.

The move came after Samsung's sponsorship of the Academy Awards broadcast in March. That deal culminated with Ellen DeGeneres' star-studded selfie, which was retweeted more than 3 million times. The Wall Street Journal(Opens in a new window) reported later that the stunt was part of a sponsorship and ad pact between ABC and Samsung.

6502565,2 Red Sox Fans Who Met on Twitter Got Married at Fenway Park,"It reads like the script of a romantic comedy -- but this is real life.

Two Boston Red Sox fans who met on Twitter because of a post from the official team account got married at Fenway Park on Friday morning -- the same the day team received its 2013 World Series championship rings.

[seealso url = ""http://mashable.com/2013/08/30/fenway-grandpa-crowdfund""]

The romance began back on Aug. 10, 2011, when the Red Sox posted this tweet for Shannon Armitage, a huge Boston supporter, at the behest of Armitage's sister, Ashley.

Special birthday shoutout to @Esenay24(Opens in a new window)! Enjoy it!â€” Boston Red Sox (@RedSox) August 10, 2011(Opens in a new window)

That got the attention of one Cody Anderson, a Red Sox fan living in Quincy, Ill.. He followed her and then tweeted this six days later.

They struck up a little Twitter correspondence, he from Illinois and she from her home in Southwick, Mass. Tweets became texts, bringing their digital courtship to a new level of intimacy. Over Memorial Day weekend in 2012, Armitage visited Anderson in Illinois and they met for the first time. In July 2013, she moved for good.

And that brings us back to Friday, when the couple got married at Fenway Park -- Boston's iconic yard -- just before the actual players received their World Series rings ahead of 2014's home-opening day game. The happy couple calls it a #DoubleRingCeremony (hashtag included).

The couple were kind enough to provide Twitter updates throughout the big day. Cody started with a general statement:

7031171,Samsung Reveals Major Graphene Breakthrough,"Graphene may as well be called the most interesting material in the world.

It's stronger than a diamond(Opens in a new window) and pretty much anything else known to man. It's an atom thick. It's incredibly conductive(Opens in a new window) and enhances communication. It could potentially replace(Opens in a new window) silicon and ultimately transform electronics.

One of its only limitations is size; most of its qualities cannot be produced at a scale that is useful in manufacturing consumer-level products. That is, until now.

[seealso slug=""tech-breakthroughs-2013""]

Researchers around the globe have experimented with graphene since its discovery in 2004. Now, scientists at Samsung's Advanced Institute of Technology (SAIT) and Sungkyunkwan University in South Korea have announced(Opens in a new window) the discovery of a new method for ""growing large area, single crystal wafer scale graphene.""

""The new method...synthesizes large-area graphene into a single crystal on a semiconductor, maintaining its electric and mechanical properties,"" Samsung wrote. It ""repeatedly synthesizes single crystal graphene on the current semiconductor wafer scale.""

Previous attempts at growing large-scale graphene wafers were unsuccessful, Samsung said, because they deteriorated some of graphene's key qualities.

It could be a major breakthrough for graphene, but it's also a major bummer for technologies companies hoping to cash in on a graphene electronics bonanza.

Handset manufacturer Nokia (soon to be fully owned by Microsoft) has been in the graphene research game since 2006. Last year, the company got a $2.3 billion grant from the European Union's Future and Emerging Technologies program to develop graphene-based technology solutions. Samsung and Sungkyunkwan University's graphene project is funded by Koreaâ€™s Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning (MSIP), and like Nokia, they have been studying the material since 2006.

It's unclear whether Samsung's breakthrough will give the electronics company the lead in graphene-based electronics, or whether it plans to share the breakthrough. Samsung already makes displays for many of the world's most popular mobile devices, including the iPhone and iPad.

One thing that remains unaddressed in Samsung's announcement is graphene's other critical limitation -- one that could prevent it from unseating silicon as the go-to material for electronics. Graphene lacks an ""energy gap"" and can't be turned on and off(Opens in a new window). Put simply, it's super-conductive and is never really ""off."" Transistors work by switching on and off, sometimes millions of times a second, to help power the world's processors.

Some say that ""doping"" the graphene, or adding chemicals to it to adjust its properties, could help, but it's unclear whether that would change some of its most prized properties, like incredible strength.

The future of technology may, to a certain extent, hinge on researchers figuring this out. Silicon prices are rising as supply steadily dwindles(Opens in a new window). Companies like Samsung, Nokia, Apple, Qualcomm and others need another option, and nothing is more attractive than graphene. If Samsung truly has cracked this commercial production nut, the future of gadgetry could be very interesting indeed.",4/4/2014 0:00,0.597598,22,10,0,4.666667,10,Lifestyle,3168.909,9807.533,5379.783,3200,0.477491,0.081323,0.046377,0.037681,0,0,1200

Silicon Valley's hundreds of thousands of workers are about to get a long, luxuriating look indeed, as HBO premieres Silicon Valley this Sunday. And already, they're obsessed.

Of all the social chatter going on around the show, a whopping 27% is coming from the real Silicon Valley, according to data from social-listening and analytics firm Fizziology(Opens in a new window) shared with Mashable.

And tech's fixation on itself isn't just limited to the Bay Area. Top tech communities drive just over 9% of chatter for HBO shows overall, but were driving nearly 35% of the conversation for Silicon Valley.

Chips and apps don't just don't play that well in Peoria, apparently -- conversation out of non-tech sectors like the Midwest were indexing lower than average, according to Fizziology. And seeing as the show features five dudes, it's perhaps no surprise that 66% of the buzz was coming from men.

So Silicon Valley is into navel-gazing ... but are they excited for the show?

That's a big yes: Most of the buzz is coming from people sharing positive reviews, planning-to-watch sentiment or just excitement that their people are [SARCASM ALERT] finally getting some recognition.

[seealso slug=""social-networks-private-messaging""]

So it's no surprise that social media platforms, the ones that view messaging as a supplemental feature, have been busy keeping up.

On Thursday, Vine released Vine Messages, the app's first foray into private messaging. It's a competitive move to keep up with Facebook (whose Messenger and Instagram apps both offer private messaging) and Snapchat.

So how can you tell these services apart, and what are their pros and cons? Here's our quick primer.

Vine Messages

History: Launched April 2014

Pros:

Includes Vine video production features (stop motion, grid lines).

Send text and/or video messages.

Send messages to people who arenâ€™t on Vine.

Cons:

Canâ€™t create group messages.

Canâ€™t send still images, only videos.

Canâ€™t send videos from camera roll.

Best Use Case: Sending a creative video.

Overview: Vine is the latest social platform to unveil private messaging, and its unrivaled video capabilities (stop motion, grid lines) should make it popular for video messages. But users canâ€™t send videos from their camera roll, and the absence of group messages puts Vine messaging at a disadvantage.

Instagram Direct

History: Launched December 2013

Pros:

Add filters to photos or videos.

Send text and/or video messages.

Send group messages.

Send existing photos and videos from the camera roll.

Cons:

Canâ€™t message people outside of Instagram

No stop motion video like Vine.

Photos must be cropped as square.

Group messages limited to 15 people.

Best Use Case: Sending artsy pictures, or videos with filters.

Overview: Instagram unveiled its messaging feature to lots of fanfare in December, but little has been said about it since. (There was some news yesterday, but it wasnâ€™t positive; actor James Franco used Instagram Direct to connect to a 17-year-old fan.)

The feature certainly doesnâ€™t detract from Instagram; it just doesnâ€™t add enough to make it a major player.

Facebook Messenger

History: Launched August 2011

Pros:

Send individual or group messages.

Save favorite or often-used groups for future use.

Free phone calls to Facebook friends using Wi-Fi.

Can send photos from camera roll.

Cons:

Canâ€™t send video messages.

Canâ€™t take pics through the app.

No filters for photos.

Canâ€™t message people who are not on Facebook.

Best Use Case: Connecting with Facebook friends whose phone numbers youâ€™ve lost.

Overview: This is the most robust app in the bunch. Messenger was poised for a big year in 2014; Facebook redesigned the app and made it faster (more like texting) in October, and Mark Zuckerberg mentioned Messenger multiple times during the companyâ€™s Q1 earnings call.

Then Facebook bought standalone messaging app WhatsApp for $16 billion, begging the question: where does Messenger fit in? Messenger supports free phone calls over Wi-Fi, making it another facet of Zuckerberg's attempt to connect the world online.

Twitter Direct Messages

History: Launched November 2006(Opens in a new window)

Pros:

Send text and/or picture messages.

Take pictures through the app, or send photos from the camera roll.

Filters and photo editing tools.

Cons:

Canâ€™t create group messages.

Canâ€™t send videos.

Can only send messages to people who follow you.

Can only receive messages from people you follow.

Messages limited to 140 characters.

Best Use Case: Continuing a Twitter exchange in private.

Overview: Twitter DMs have been part of the service from the start. Itâ€™s surprising, then, that the feature has not evolved more over the past eight years. You can send picture messages, as of December, but you canâ€™t send videos, you canâ€™t create group messages, and each individual message is limited to 140 characters. Itâ€™s a rather simple offering.

The rules about who you can message are helpful -- you wonâ€™t get spammed by people you donâ€™t follow -- but they are also limiting. There seems to be lots of room for growth here, and we expect Twitter to do just that down the road.

Snapchat

History: Launched July 2011

Pros:

Messages disappear -- send anything you want.

Can send picture or video messages.

Can draw or doodle on messages, or include a typed message.

Can save snaps for 24 hours if wanted

Cons:

Messages disappear -- donâ€™t send stuff you want to save.

People can screen grab your images (and they will, trust us).

Text is limited; canâ€™t fit more than 78 characters, usually fewer.

Canâ€™t send text-only messages.

Canâ€™t create ongoing group messages.

Best Use Case: Sending goofy or inappropriate photos and videos.

Overview: There isnâ€™t much pressure with Snapchat, which is a good thing. You arenâ€™t going to use the service for serious back-and-forth messaging, and group messaging doesnâ€™t exist. You can send stuff thatâ€™s fun, goofy, or inappropriate, and know that it will exist for just a short time on the receiving end.

The danger, of course, is that recipients can screen grab your photos if you want. So go crazy, but not too crazy -- or get some more trustworthy friends.",4/4/2014 0:00,0.8125,3,0,2,4.525773,10,00000,2255.44,9807.533,4951.011,2400,0.470556,-0.28222,0.010309,0.041237,1,-0.8,1100

7030924,"Stephen Colbert Is CBS' Top Choice to Succeed Letterman, and He's Into It","UPDATE, April 10, 12:50 p.m. ET: CBS confirmed that Stephen Colbert will take over David Letterman's slot on the Late Show.

Stephen Colbert is CBS' top choice to replace the retiring David Letterman, and has indicated that he's willing to take over the Late Show when the time comes, people familiar with both sides of the discussions tell Mashable.

Colbert has not had any formal contract discussions with CBS, and no agreement is in place, but sources tell Mashable that he first engaged with network executives while Letterman was still mulling the timing of his retirement. Though CBS has had conversations with other candidates, including Colbert's Comedy Central counterpart Jon Stewart, individuals with knowledge of the situation say Colbert is currently the front-and-center candidate.

A CBS spokesman told Mashable: â€œWeâ€™re not commenting on any rumors or speculation about succession.â€ Comedy Central had no comment.

Colbert's contract to host The Colbert Report on Comedy Central runs through the end of 2014, which would free him up in time to move over to CBS when Letterman ends his 33-year run in late-night TV. Letterman left the exact date of his departure vague while announcing his retirement plans on Thursday.

â€œWe donâ€™t have the timing of this precisely down; it will be at least a year or so,"" Letterman said on Thursday's episode of the Late Show. ""But at some time in the not-too-distant future â€” 2015, for the love of God.""

Colbert would leave behind the pseudo-conservative persona he's cultivated at The Colbert Report and just be himself at his CBS home, one of the individuals told Mashable. He has stepped out of character on rare occasion, though not on his show, and possesses the same wry, incisive interview skills that Letterman has showcased for decades.

A few questions remain for CBS in its pursuit of Colbert; money is a big one. The gap between a potential network payday and a Comedy Central salary has significantly narrowed in recent years. Plus, Colbert is meticulously topical in his selection of guests, many of whom aren't stars, but the Late Show gig would force him to shoot the breeze with all manner of celebrities peddling movies and TV shows. That isn't to say he wouldn't do it well -- but would he want to?

There's also more of a workload: five nights a week to cover an hour, versus four nights doing 30 minutes. But in the end, the draw of being Letterman's replacement could be too strong for Colbert, who is a friend and admirer of Letterman's.

These conversations represent the state of play at this time, but anything can happen in Letterman's remaining year. Twitter and Facebook were filled with calls to diversify the mostly white male late-night lineup, and Colbert still has more than eight months left on his Comedy Central contract.

Other names that have come up in discussions for Letterman's replacement have included Neil Patrick Harris, who just finished up How I Met Your Mother on CBS, and Craig Ferguson, who comes on after The Late Show With David Letterman. Harris could remain a wild card, but Ferguson, though well-liked by the network in his later slot on The Late Late Show With Craig Ferguson, has never been seen as the heir apparent.

At one point, Stewart was seriously considered for the Late Show post, but his prospects have steadily faded over time as sentiment coalesced around Colbert. The Daily Show host has finished shooting his feature film directorial debut Rosewater, and is said to be passionate about continuing that and other off-air pursuits, which a major late-night hosting job would not easily permit.

CBS is a cousin of Comedy Central via Viacom, from which the broadcast network was spun off in 2006. Stewart and Colbert enjoy similar ratings, but The Daily Show is still considered Comedy Central's flagship program, which would make a Stewart poach potentially more fraught. Colbert, who will celebrate his 50th birthday next month, made his bones as a correspondent on Stewart's show, leaving in 2005 to start his spinoff series that immediately follows it; the shows have essentially gone hand-in-hand ever since, with the two hosts joining forces for special election coverage and other events.

The Colbert Report has won Emmys for writing for a variety, music or comedy program in 2008, 2010 and 2013; it won its first outstanding variety series Emmy last year, snapping a 10-year run for Stewart's show.

Though CBS has been quietly lining up his replacement for months, by all accounts, Letterman's decision to leave was entirely his own, and was largely telegraphed when he signed a one-year contract extension to remain through 2015. Since then, the 66-year-old Letterman had been having ongoing conversations with CBS CEO Leslie Moonves, who released the following statement after Letterman's announcement Thursday:

When Dave decided on a one-year extension for his most recent contract, we knew this day was getting closer, but that doesnâ€™t make the moment any less poignant for us. For 21 years, David Letterman has graced our Networkâ€™s air in late night with wit, gravitas and brilliance unique in the history of our medium. During that time, Dave has given television audiences thousands of hours of comedic entertainment, the sharpest interviews in late night, and brilliant moments of candor and perspective around national events. Heâ€™s also managed to keep many celebrities, politicians and executives on their toes â€“ including me. There is only one David Letterman. His greatness will always be remembered here, and he will certainly sit among the pantheon of this business. On a personal note, itâ€™s been a privilege to get to know Dave and to enjoy a terrific relationship. Itâ€™s going to be tough to say goodbye. Fortunately, we wonâ€™t have to do that for another year or so. Until then, we look forward to celebrating Daveâ€™s remarkable show and incredible talents.

That's essentially the premise behind The Basketball Tournament(Opens in a new window) (called TBT for short), a single-elimination, five-on-five hoops tournament. Its 32 teams will be culled to one champion and that champion will be rewarded with a no-strings-attached wire transfer of $500,000.

[seealso url = ""http://mashable.com/2013/11/25/kiwi-gardner-basketball-youtube""]

It's open to anyone -- collegians, pros, you, me -- who can recruit enough votes for their team on the TBT website. Online voting is already well underway and runs until May 1. Then, most of the tournament runs from June 6 to 8, followed by a two-week break before the championship on June 28.

""The most appealing things about March Madness are the high stakes, the win-or-go-home format and how you can read the emotion of the players,"" tournament founder Jonathan Mugar tells Mashable. ""We wanted to couple that with this idea that any elite or non-elite player could enter -- that the format could be opened up so that absolutely anyone who wants to play can play.""

It started with a text

Mugar is a 38-year-old former Division III basketball player who now works as a TV producer. One morning about three years ago, he woke up and texted his buddy Dan Friel a simple question: What do you think would happen if someone just threw a bunch of prize money together and put on a basketball tournament that was open to anybody in the world?

Fast forward to today, and that's exactly what the two pals are doing. Mugar has laid aside TV work. Friel is taking a leave of absence from his job as an Assistant United States Attorney in Louisiana prosecuting public corruption and fraud related to Hurricane Katrina.

Outside investors who -- for now, at least -- request to remain anonymous have ponied up the prize money. Now all that's left is to stage the actual tournament -- and watch the online votes pile up and determine who gets to compete.

""The terrifying thing with an open tourney is you have no control over who's gonna enter and no control over who's gonna win,"" Mugar says.

These teams are legit

If you think it's just a bunch of social media nerds who have entered the voting fray so far, think again. More than 100 teams have entered (doing so is free), and more than 35 have already qualified for possible inclusion by gathering 100 registered fans on the TBT website. The top 24 vote-getters are automatically entered -- regardless of actual ability -- and then eight more will be picked by TBT officials based on a variety of factors to fill out the 32-team field.

But there are more twists here, too. Rosters don't have to be finalized until May 1, when voting ends. So some enterprising campaigner could hypothetically build a huge vote lead then auction off spots on his team just before the roster deadline. Teams are tasked with deciding among themselves how to divvy up the $500,000 winning prize, should they be victorious. Each player's ""salary"" is listed on his team page (rosters are maxed at 10 players and one ""supporter"").

Now, a moment to highlight some of the more interesting entrants(Opens in a new window) that have qualified so far.

Cornell Sweet Sixteen(Opens in a new window): Remember that Cornell team that made an improbable March Madness run in 2010? They're baaack -- this time in TBT. Many of the team's best players have reunited for another shot at glory spurred by smart, team-first basketball. Talk about old school.

St. Anthony(Opens in a new window): St. Anthony is a Catholic high school in Jersey City that has produced several NBA players and dozens of college stars over the past three decades under legendary coach Bob Hurley, Sr. But the school is also a bit strapped for cash. So this team, comprised of St. Anthony alumni, is entered as a non-profit participant with the idea of raising money for St. Anthony -- and awareness of its plight. The full roster hasn't been revealed yet, but alum Terry Dehere, who played six years in the NBA, is already signed on as general manager.

Barstool Sports Philly(Opens in a new window): Barstool Sports is a popular sports blog that's entered a team of its own. They haven't filled out their full roster yet, either. But they appear off to a solid start with a 6'6"" small forward and 6'8"" power forward already on board. Given the site's popularity among young males, however, finding some ringers should be no problem at all.

Air Force Bomb Squad(Opens in a new window): This squad is made of guys who played in college at the Air Force Academy. All of them have or are currently serving as active-duty Air Force officers, and their page on the TBT site says the ""tournament will be used to provide a much needed reunion between former teammates."" They also say they'll donate a ""significant portion"" of their earnings to charity or the Air Force hoops program -- provided, of course, that they win.

Then there's Showtime(Opens in a new window), a team made of up of basketball-mad former high school and small-college players that has surged to fourth-place in online fan voting. How? In part by hitting the streets of Virginia, where they're based, and handing out fliers imploring locals to help them make the tourney by voting online.

Where do we go from here?

Rosters are locked and the top 24 teams in fandom voting are automatically entered in The Basketball Tournament on May 1. The final eight will be selected, Mugar says, based on talent level, fan outreach effort and backstory. (So a team like St. Anthony or Air Force Bomb Squad, presumably, would move to the front of the line if they didn't qualify on votes alone.)

Then it all goes down at Philadelphia University. Round 1 is June 6, the second and third rounds are June 7, then the semifinals are June 8. Win a game and advance; lose a game and go home.

During the more than two-week break between the semifinals and June 28 final, a fan vote will determine which finalist will host the championship game and how long the championship game's shot clock should be. With $500,000 on the line, it's also a good bet the final two teams will use that time to strategize and practice.

At this point, if you're anything like me, your main question is: How in the name of God do I watch this thing?

As of now, you can't. But Mugar says you should be able to. He and Friel and their anonymous partners are still in the process of finalizing TBT's longterm business and marketing plans; they'd ideally like to make it an annual thing. As for how you might be able to watch this June, Mugar says one option, in particular, would be most appropriate.

""I really love the idea of streaming the games,"" Mugar tells Mashable. ""It just fits the idea of what we're trying to do so perfectly -- make a basketball tournament that's truly open to all and then bring it to basketball's biggest fans, wherever they are.""

6781696,Brace Yourselves: 15 New Types of Twitter Ads May Be Coming,"Twitter is stepping up its advertising game in a big way, according to reports.

New app install ads, among other ad formats, are coming to the service in the next few months, according to multiple reports that surfaced this week. In total, Twitter is planning to add 15 new types of ads, and CEO Dick Costolo showed them off to a group of ad execs at company headquarters last week, according to The Wall Street Journal(Opens in a new window)

[seealso slug=""twitter-2013""]

The most well-known of these new formats will be app install ads, which enable advertisers to include a ""download now""-style button within the ad that takes consumers to the app store. A Twitter blog post (Opens in a new window)from February mentions the ads and their functionality within Twitter cards. (Cards help advertisers package their content within a tweet.)

Reports from this week suggest the ads are nearing launch. It's an ad type particularly popular with mobile game developers, and users first started to see these app install ads over the past few days.

Other reported ad formats build off the same idea by using an embeddable button to immediately connect consumers with companies. Twitter has been experimenting with a ""click-to-call"" button, and is also working with payments company Stripe to create shoppable Twitter ads, according to The Journal.

It's not surprising that Twitter would turn to this form of advertising given the success Facebook has had using them. The social network first offered app install ads in 2012, and users downloaded more than 245 million apps through the ads last year alone, according to BuzzFeed(Opens in a new window).

Kidney stone

I'm always on the lookout for new and interesting specimens to image and when I had kidney stones a few years ago I managed to collect one. I decided to image in the light microscope, Micro CT and also under the Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). The resulting image was taken using a Zeiss MA10 SEM and false colored using Adobe Photoshop. The size of the stone is 2mm across (which is quite small for a kidney stone).

Kidney stones form when salts, minerals and chemicals in the urine (for example calcium oxalate and uric acid) clump together and solidify. Small kidney stones are often passed naturally, but larger stones sometimes get stuck in the kidney or in the tubes that carry urine out of the body.

My image depicts the nerve fibers, or wiring, of the healthy human brain. Brain cells communicate with each other through these fibers and we can visualize them in every individual using a specialized MRI scan. The colors represent the direction of the fibers: blue for those that travel up and down; green for front to back; and red for left to right.

I am continually astounded by the number and complexity of these nerve fibers; what information do these connections carry and how do they orchestrate complex mental processes? My research combines these images of connectivity with neural response patterns in order to understand the complex circuitry of the brain, and how it ultimately shapes who we are.

This is a density-dependent color scanning electron micrograph of the surface of human heart (aortic valve) tissue. The spherical particles show calcification. The orange color identifies denser material (calcified material composed of calcium phosphate), while structures that appear in green are less dense (corresponding to the organic component of the tissue).

The discovery of calcified particles shows that calcification in the cardiovascular system is more complex than being just a regular process of bone formation.

Color was then added to the black-and-white image.

7030934,Amazon Fire TV Is a Great Living-Room Companion,"Is Amazon's Fire TV the ultimate living-room device? It's not perfect, but it certainly has potential.

Amazon unveiled its Fire TV set-top box on Wednesday to a market already crowded with players, both big and small. The company's goal with Fire TV is not to merely compete with the likes of Roku and Apple, but also to bring its full ecosystem of content, including games, to the living room.

In a lot of ways, Fire TV is everything Google TV should have been, but wasn't. Yes, Google TV was supposed to integrate with live TV, but that never worked well. Instead, Fire TV is a great example of bringing the world of mobile apps and games to television in a way that makes sense, and is easy to use.

So, does Fire TV live up to the hype? We've spent a few days putting the $99 device through its paces.

Design and Specs

Amazon did a terrific job with the design of the Fire TV. The box itself is square, nondescript and remarkably thin. Unlike the Apple TV and Roku 3, the Fire TV doesn't have curved edges -- this thing is sharp -- but the overall look is sleek and discreet.

Although the Fire TV is small and thin (its height is about the diameter of a dime, around three-quarters of an inch), it has more heft in it than you may expect. The Fire TV isn't heavy, per se, but you can definitely tell that Amazon has packed tons of stuff into this box.

Amazon is really hyping the power of the Fire TV, focusing on its quad-core processor and ""dedicated"" GPU. During the company's presentation, I remarked that the Fire TV was basically a Kindle Fire HDX tablet without the screen.

Looking at iFixit's Fire TV teardown(Opens in a new window), I wasn't far off.

iFixit's teardown of the Fire TV. Credit: iFixit

The Fire TV has a Snapdragon 600 SoC (system on chip), which includes an Ardeno 320 GPU, a quad-core processor and 2GB of RAM. This is the same chipset used in the Galaxy S4 and the 2013 HTC One. This isn't quite as high-end as the Snapdragon 800 found in the Kindle Fire HDX, but it's considerably more powerful than any of the other current crop of set-top box/low-cost gaming systems on the market.

From a specs perspective, the only aspect that feels limiting about the Fire TV is its internal storage. The Fire TV has 8GB of flash storage, which can be used to store games and other apps. This will be fine for most users, but if you find yourself using the Fire TV to play lots of games, we can see 8GB getting filled up very, very quickly. I'll discuss this in-depth later on, but some games can be over 1GB, which means it would be possible to fill up the Fire TV with under 10 games installed.

In a perfect world, the Fire TV would have an SD or microSD slot to make it easy to expand storage.

In terms of ports, the Fire TV is fully loaded. It has an HDMI port, optical audio output and Ethernet. There is also a USB 2.0 port, although that isn't enabled to do anything at the moment, except for debugging and interfacing in developer mode. Like the Apple TV and Roku 3, the Fire TV is HDMI only, so if you have an older TV without an HDMI port, it won't work.

Setup

Setting up the Fire TV is remarkably simple. Plug the 13-watt power adaptor into the unit, connect it to an HDMI cable (not included), put batteries in the included remote and that's it.

There is no power button on the device. To turn it off, unplug it from the wall or the power adaptor.

Once the unit is on, it will search for the Bluetooth remote. If it doesn't find it after a few seconds, the on-screen menu helpfully explains what to press on the remote to get things paired.

Once paired, the next step is to walk through the setup process. Although Amazon has made a big deal out of its voice search, and how the Fire TV removes the need to hunt and peck to enter information, when it comes to setting up your Wi-Fi network, you have to do just that. The Fire TV does support Wi-Fi Direct, so if your router has that feature enabled, you can set up with less fuss. Otherwise, yes, you will need to enter in your password using an on-screen keyboard.

Setting up the Fire TV is a snap. Credit:

For both wired and wireless connections, users can alter the IP, gateway and DNS address; so if you have some specific networking needs, the Fire TV is surprisingly robust.

When you buy a Fire TV, it can come pre-registered to your Amazon account; this means that as soon as the unit boots up, it has access to your purchased or rented Amazon videos, is tied to your Amazon credit card and can plug into Amazon Cloud Drive photos.

If you don't have an Amazon Prime subscription, you can get a free 30-day trial. It's worth noting, however, that the Fire TV is really designed around Prime Instant and Amazon's ecosystem in general.

Voice Search: Great When You Can Use It

One of the hallmark features of the Fire TV is its innovative voice search. This isn't the first time we've seen voice search in the living room; the original Kinect for Xbox 360 had it, and it's a prominent feature on the Xbox One. However, this is the first time we've seen voice search integrated into a device at the Fire TV's price point.

Use voice search by holding down a microphone button on the Bluetooth remote, and saying your search selection out loud. Release the button, and a search takes place.

Voice recognition is good on the Fire TV -- I very rarely found myself having to repeat my phrase or search query -- but it's not perfect. Still, it was reliable enough to use as a primary search method.

In addition to searching for titles of movies and TV shows, you can search for actors, directors and genres. Searching for ""Oscar winners,"" for instance, will bring up films such as The Silence of the Lambs, while searching for cop shows brings up NYPD Blue.

Want to search the Fire TV? Just talk to it. Credit:

If content is available on another service, you can select a ""More Ways to Watch"" button to see other viewing options for a show. Here's the problem: Right now, the only other service supported by voice search is Hulu Plus.

If I search for Scandal, for example, I see the episodes available on Amazon Instant and Hulu Plus. The problem is that Amazon's episodes aren't available for free. Netflix, however, has the first two seasons of Scandal available for free, but that does not come up in my voice search.

Amazon said it wants to work with all content providers to bring their content to voice search, but for now, it's really only designed to work with Amazon content. That's a shame because a unified search option -- using voice or not -- is something sorely needed. Roku has done a lot to integrate unified search into its software in recent builds. The Xbox One and TiVo Roamio have great unified search features too.

For now, voice search is great, but it's not universal, which means you'll still need to hunt and peck in other apps and in other parts of the system.

Third-Party Services

The Fire TV is based on Android, albeit a customized version similar to what Amazon uses for the Kindle Fire HDX tablets.

As a result, all of the third-party services and apps are actually Android apps running on the TV; this means Netflix, Hulu Plus, Crackle, Pandora and others are actually Android apps. I mention this because although the Android interface usually works well for a 10-foot experience, it isn't as good as the HTML5 version of those services for other set-top box and Internet TVs.

Netflix, for example, has a really great HTML5 interface that runs on Roku, certain Blu-ray players, and the PlayStation 3 and 4. That experience is, in my mind, superior to the Android app blown up to fit a big screen.

I'm being really nitpicky here, however, because third-party services work as expected. What's more, out of the box, Amazon has a great selection of third-party services, including nearly every major video service in North America. The one exception is HBO Go. HBO Go is available on Roku, Apple TV, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 and several other devices. Fire TV supports Showtime Anytime, but not HBO Go. That said, the Android nature of the device means that bringing support for other services should be simple.

The Amazon Fire TV also supports third-party apps such as Hulu Plus. Credit: Mashable, Christina Ascani

It's important to note that because content channels tend to be siloed, voice search does not work within those apps, and there isn't a unified way to view content or playlists from across various services. To me, that would be the only thing Amazon could do to upgrade the experience.

Watching content from other services proved solid. I found Netflix buffered a bit more on the Fire TV than on my Roku 3 or Apple TV, but I haven't had enough time to do extensive tests to investigate the cause.

With Hulu Plus, I did have some issues playing back some content in the app. Felicity wouldn't play back on the Fire TV, but it worked fine on an iPad, Roku 3, Apple TV and Chromecast. That was the only show that gave me issues, and I've reported the problem to both Amazon and Hulu Plus.

Games

Streaming content aside, the real differentiator with the Fire TV is that it is also a bonafide game machine. No, the Fire TV doesn't compete with the likes of an Xbox One or PlayStation 4, but Ouya, GameStick and other Android-based game devices should be worried. Very worried.

Games for the Fire TV are Android ports from the Amazon Appstore modified to work well on a large screen, and with a game controller or the Amazon remote.

The Bluetooth game controller doesn't come with the Fire TV, but is available for $39.99; this price includes 1,000 Amazon coins to use toward buying games or in-app purchases. Other Bluetooth controllers will work with the Fire TV, as well, including models from Moga.

Amazon can't guarantee that every Bluetooth Android controller will work with the Fire TV, but the company isn't doing anything overtly proprietary in what it supports. I think that's really fantastic, especially for existing Moga owners. We'll test more Bluetooth controllers with the Fire TV in the future, and post our results.

Up to four controllers can be connected to the Fire TV at once, but I only played with one controller connected.

As for the controller itself, it's nice. While it's not as perfect as an Xbox 360/Xbox One controller (what is?), it feels good in the hand. The buttons are responsive, the analog sticks are solid and I noticed no discernible input lag when playing games on the TV.

The controller can also control the Fire TV itself, so you can use it to easily make your way around the general entertainment console.

As for the number of compatible games, Amazon has a large list(Opens in a new window) that will only continue to grow.

Playing Asphalt 8, Gameloft's racing game, on the big screen was a pure joy. Sev Zero is a new exclusive Fire TV game from Amazon Game Studios that is part tower defense, part first-person shooter. It's a ton of fun, and a great way to show off the power of the Fire TV.

Other games, including Telltale Games' fantastic The Walking Dead, look great on the system.

That said, games ""optimized"" for the controller work don't work as well as you might expect. Crazy Taxi is one of my favorite games of all time (I love the mobile version on iOS and Android). I was so excited to play it on the big screen, but the experience was incredibly disappointing. Although the controller works with the game, switching from drive to reverse requires some on-screen toggling before the sticks will work well. The controller support was added in such a way that made me think Sega didn't put a lot of time into it.

I'm a forgiving customer who doesn't mind that my $4.99 purchase (for a game I've already bought four times if you include Dreamcast, Xbox 360, iOS and Android) had a less-than-stellar controller experience, but I can see a lot of users getting frustrated by situations like that.

I urge game developers to ensure their games work well with the Fire TV controller -- don't just do a quick remapping job.

Storage Woes

Downloading some of the larger games, including Asphalt 8, means that it's very easy to fill up the 8GB of internal storage on the Fire TV. It's also easy to uninstall games from the Fire TV, but I think that the more people use the Fire TV as a place to play games, the less they will want to uninstall them.

I'm confident that its limited storage and lack of microSD or SD was because Amazon needed to keep costs down. That's perfectly acceptable and for most users, won't be a major issue. Still, I hope some solution -- be it adding external USB support or some sort of cloud-play option for select games -- is in the works.

I harp on the storage point only because I do think Amazon has something really special with the Fire TV. This is the first commercial product I've seen that can bring the casual mobile-gaming experience to television.

One of the biggest challenges facing Ouya and others like it is getting a good selection of AAA games from big developers in a storefront that people can trust. Amazon solves that problem, while also having the resources to invest in its own gaming brand.

Who Is This For?

Some of the negative reviews on Amazon.com for the Fire TV lament the lack of access to local media files and the inability to connect to an external USB device. To those users, I say: I understand your frustration (although Plex for Android is available and that's one solution), but the Fire TV isn't being billed as that type of device.

The Fire TV has the potential to be tweaked, hacked and customized beyond any other major streaming box on the market, but it is very clearly meant for people who want to enjoy streaming content from a variety of services, along with the ability to play games on their television. The Fire TV achieves those goals beautifully, especially at $99

7030928,"Apple Emails Reveal Concerns Over Samsung's Success, 'Holy War' With Google","A document presented Friday in federal court for the Apple versus Samsung patent trial revealed that some Apple officials had serious concerns about the iPhone's competitive position vis-Ã -vis the growing popularity of Android smartphones.

Shown during a cross-examination of Phil Schiller, a 2013 email from Apple's senior vice-president suggests he was seriously concerned about how the consumer market perceived the iPhone, as compared with Samsung's line of smartphones.

[seealso slug=""apple-v-samsung-trial""]

Posted by Recode(Opens in a new window), the email was sent to Apple's ad agency Media Arts Laboratories, and said: ""I watched the Samsung pre-superbowl ad that launched todayâ€¦ It's pretty good and I canâ€™t help but thinking 'these guys are feeling it (like an athlete that can't miss because they are in a zone), while we struggle to nail a compelling brief on iPhone.""

This is one of a few instances in which Apple's concern about its competitors has been revealed in such detail.

""Something drastic has to change. Fast,"" Schiller wrote in a portion of the email obtained(Opens in a new window) by CNET.

Other internal Apple documents presented during Samsung's cross-examination of Schiller indicate that Apple's view of the market at the time saw growth in larger-screen smartphones (or phablets) priced above $300, as well as devices priced below the $300 mark.

In another set of documents revealed in court earlier this week(Opens in a new window), an email from late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs sent on Oct. 24, 2010 offered insight into what he planned for the company's future.

The full email, posted(Opens in a new window) by The Verge, delved into various topics, including an upcoming ""Holy War with Google,"" Apple being ""in danger of hanging on to old paradigm too long (innovator's dilemma)"" and plans for the iPhone 4S (termed as the ""plus"" iPhone 4) and the iPhone 5.

Jobs' email also touches on competitive issues, including a strategy to ""catch up to Android"" focused on notifications, tethering, speech and Siri.

Most interestingly, the email(Opens in a new window) also mentions the future of Apple TV. Jobs' bullet points on ""Apple TV 2"" include a strategy to ""stay in the living room game and make a great 'must have' accessory for iOS devices,"" adding content from NBC, CBS, Viacom and HBO, as well as a possible TV-subscription service.

7010965,Chinese Ship Detects Possible Black Box Signal in Search for Malaysia Airlines Plane,"This story was updated most recently at 12:35 p.m. ET on April 5.

This could be it.

A Chinese ship searching for the missing Malaysia Airlines plane has detected a pulse signal on the same frequency used by black boxes, according(Opens in a new window) to China's state-run Xinhua News Agency.

The Haixun 01 heard the ping with a frequency of 37.5 kHz about 1,050 miles off Perth, Australia in the southern Indian Ocean, which is significant because it's not a sound of nature or animals in the ocean -- it's man made. Two other ships that searched the area on Saturday, the Royal Navy's HMS Echo and the Royal Australian Navy's Ocean Shield, reported no findings(Opens in a new window).

A CCTV News reporter on board the ship said searchers first detected the frequency Friday, and then again on Saturday. It lasted for 15 minutes before the signal was lost.

This could mean the Chinese are using equipment in the search not previously disclosed(Opens in a new window) to the Australian authorities, according to Mary Shiavo, former inspector general of the United States Department of Transportation.

The signal was reportedly picked up at 25 degrees south latitude and 101 degrees east latitude, and comes as a Chinese plane reported spotting a number of white objects floating in the search area.

Australian Defense Minister David Johnston warned that even if this turns out to be Flight 370's black box -- and it's not clear if it is -- it could take weeks(Opens in a new window) to find its location on the sea bed. ""There's a huge chance of false positives here,"" he warned. The CCTV News reporter on board the ship said rescuers believe the signal is not exclusive to black boxes, so it could be from another piece of equipment.

Australian Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston, head of the Joint Agency Coordination Centre, said reports that the Haixun 01 had detected electronic pulse signals related to Flight 370 could not be verified at this time.

""I have been advised that a series of sounds have been detected by a Chinese ship in the search area. The characteristics reported are consistent with the aircraft black box. A number of white objects were also sighted on the surface about 90 kilometres from the detection area. However, there is no confirmation at this stage that the signals and the objects are related to the missing aircraft,"" Houston said. ""Advice tonight from the Australian Maritime Safety Authority's Rescue Coordination Centre (RCC) and the Australian Transport Safety Bureau is that they cannot verify any connection to the missing aircraft.""

""The RCC in Australia has spoken to the RCC in China and asked for any further information that may be relevant,"" he added. ""The deployment of RAAF assets to the area where the Chinese ship detected the sounds is being considered.""

The Chinese government informed(Opens in a new window) Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak of the development earlier today.

Up to ten military planes, three civil jets and 11 ships searched the area on Saturday. The Australian Transport Safety Bureau said it continues to refine the search area where the aircraft reportedly entered the water â€œbased on continuing ground-breaking and multi-disciplinary technical analysis of satellite communication and aircraft performance, passed from the international air crash investigative team comprising analysts from Malaysia, the United States, the UK, China and Australia.â€

The plane has been missing since March 8 when it vanished from the skies, as it entered Vietnamese airspace -- and hasn't been heard from since. There were 239 people on board, and their families say they want answers.

The search to find the plane's black box is running out of time. Batteries in the flight recorders only last 30 days, which means the black box could go silent(Opens in a new window) as soon as Monday. If that happens, we might never know what happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370.

3131382,Conspiracy Theorist Sues Seattle Police Over Kurt Cobain Photos,"One Seattle man, who for 20 years has publicly claimed Kurt Cobain was murdered, is suing the Seattle Police Department after it released 24 new photos taken at the scene of the Nirvana frontman's death at his home on Lake Washington Boulevard.

Although the photos don't reveal anything new about the case, and are similar to ones released at the time of Cobain's death on April 5, 1994, Richard Lee claims they should have been released 20 years ago. Seattle police revealed the never-before-seen photos after a brief reexamination of the case's evidence, according to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer(Opens in a new window). Police had discovered several undeveloped rolls of film, but the case remains closed.

Cobain's death, which was ruled a suicide, shocked Nirvana fans around the world. The singer was found at his Seattle home on April 8, 1994, three days after he shot himself(Opens in a new window) in the head with a shotgun.

Lee, the man filing the lawsuit, describes himself as an investigative journalist, and had several unsuccessful runs for mayor of Seattle. The 50-year-old made a name for himself by promoting baseless claims that Cobain was killed, and that someone is trying to cover it up.

He was one of the first people to publicly question the circumstances surrounding Cobain's death, and has remained one of the few who publicly promote conspiracy theories related to the case. A week after Cobain's body was discovered, Lee hosted a show on public-access television called ""Kurt Cobain Was Murdered,"" the Post-Intelligencer reported.

Over the years, Lee has had numerous altercations with law-enforcement officers involved in the Cobain case, as well as those close to the musician. Nirvana band member Krist Novoselic obtained a restraining order against Lee in 2000. In 2005, Lee was arrested while attempting to ask Courtney Love (Cobain's widow) questions about his death during an unrelated court hearing in Los Angeles.

Lee will be his own attorney in the lawsuit, according to the Post-Intelligencer. He claims police should have given him all available photos after he requested the material at the time of Cobain's death. Lee adds that police refused to provide him with the new photos, even though they gave pictures to several media outlets.

Lee asked to have a trial on a wide range of issues concerning police disclosures involving Cobain's death, but hasn't gone after the police in the one area where he could have a shot at winning.

In Washington, any government agency that doesn't disclose public records is liable to pay $5 to $100 per document per day for as many days as the agency withheld the material, according to the Post-Intelligencer. For 24 photos, that sum could result in quite a bit of money, and government organizations have previously been ordered to pay six-figure sums. So far, though, Lee hasn't requested that a judge look into whether the fine is applicable in his case.",4/5/2014 0:00,0.455508,17,12,0,4.696281,6,Social Media,1520.146,4600,3156.537,1398.5,0.623319,0.334587,0.097107,0.016529,1,0.5,1900
7030835,Local Crowd Attacks Aid Workers at Guinean Ebola Treatment Center,"Enraged by an Ebola outbreak that has killed 86 people across the country, a group of Guineans attacked aid workers at an Ebola treatment center, accusing them of having brought the disease over, according to multiple reports.

The attack forced workers from Doctors Without Borders to suspend operations at the clinic in Macenta, a town in the nation's south, where the disease has killed 14 people. Some members of the mob hurled rocks at aid workers, but no one was injured, the Associated Press(Opens in a new window) reported.

The Guinean government quickly defended Doctors Without Borders, saying the organization and other groups have been instrumental(Opens in a new window) in containing the Ebola outbreak.

""The international community has rapidly mobilized to help us in these difficult moments with considerable medical support and specialists on the ground at the disease's epicenter,"" the statement said. ""That's why the government is calling on people to stay calm and allow our partners to help us eradicate this epidemic.""

Although the virus is only transferrable via bodily fluids, it is one of the deadliest diseases on the planet, and there is no cure. The strain found in Guinea has killed up to 90% of those affected, and all Ebola strains have killed around 1,500 people since the first known outbreak in 1976(Opens in a new window). Experts say the disease could have been transferred to humans via fruit bats in West Africa after someone ate a bat, or bit into a fruit that a bat had also eaten. The disease causes vomiting, diarrhea and external bleeding.

Liberia, which shares a border with Guinea, has confirmed seven deaths out of 14 cases as a result of Ebola, according to Reuters. Nearby Mali is also looking into three potential cases, and Sierra Leone is investigating a possible small outbreak of its own.

Misinformation about the Ebola patient-intake process is likely what led to the small riot, the AP reported. Residents are concerned that the clinic was transferring patients without Ebola to an area filled with confirmed Ebola patients, therefore putting relatively healthy people in contact with the deadly disease.

Patients who might have Ebola at the clinic are actually kept in a separate section for observation. If the case is confirmed, they are moved to an area for those who have the disease.

7010003,5 Ways to Follow Up Without Being Annoying,"I had a conversation with a friend the other day about his job search that went something like this:

Friend: I wrote to him last week and still havenâ€™t heard back. Itâ€™s so frustrating.

Me: Why not follow up and check in?

Friend: I donâ€™t want to be annoying.

The fear is understandable. No one wants to be annoying(Opens in a new window) or bothersome to a professional contact, especially when you want a job, meeting, sales dollars, or something else very important from that person.

But hereâ€™s the rub. The average person can get a few hundred emails a day. That makes it pretty tough to respond to all of them, and things naturally fall to the bottom of the list. If you donâ€™t get a response, it doesnâ€™t mean that someoneâ€™s ignoring you -- it just may mean that he or she is too busy.

So, to the question: Should you follow up? Absolutely. In fact, itâ€™s your job. And how often should you do so? One philosophy is: As many times as it takes. The important thing is to do it the right way. Or, as some may call it, to be â€œpleasantly persistent.â€

Here are a few tips on how to (nicely) follow up with that hiring manager, sales lead, or VIPâ€”and get the answer youâ€™re looking for.

Rule 1: Be Overly Polite and Humble

That seems obvious enough, but a lot of people take it personally when they donâ€™t hear back from someone right away. Resist the urge to get upset or mad, and never take your feelings out in an email, saying something like, â€œYou havenâ€™t responded yet,â€ or â€œYou ignored my first email.â€ Just maintain an extremely polite tone throughout the entire email thread. Showing that youâ€™re friendly and that you understand how busy your contact is is a good way to keep him or her interested (and not mad).

Rule 2: Persistent Doesnâ€™t Mean Every Day

Sending a follow-up email every day doesnâ€™t show you have gumption or passion, it shows you donâ€™t respect a personâ€™s time. The general rule of thumb(Opens in a new window) is to give at least a week before following up. Any sooner, and it might come off as pushy; let too much time pass, and you risk the other person not having any clue who you are. I typically start off with an email every week, and then switch to every couple of weeks.

Rule 3: Directly Ask if You Should Stop Reaching Out

If youâ€™ve followed up a few times and still havenâ€™t heard back, itâ€™s worth directly asking if you should stop following up. After all, you donâ€™t want to waste your time, either. Iâ€™ll sometimes say, â€œI know how busy you are and completely understand if you just havenâ€™t had the time to reach back out. But I donâ€™t want to bombard you with emails if youâ€™re not interested. Just let me know if youâ€™d prefer I stop following up.â€ Most people respect honesty and donâ€™t want to waste someoneâ€™s time, and theyâ€™ll at least let you know one way or another.

Rule 4: Stand Out in a Good Way

I once had someone trying to sell me something that I was remotely interested in but that was nowhere near the top of my priority list. Every week, heâ€™d send me a new email quickly re-explaining what he soldâ€”as well as a suggestion for good pizza to try around the city. Why? He had seen a blog post where I mentioned Iâ€™d eat pizza 24/7 if I could, and cleverly worked that into his follow-up. It made him stand out in a good way, and as a result, we eventually had a call(Opens in a new window).

The lesson: If done well, a little creativity in your follow up can go a long way. If youâ€™re following up about a job, try Alexandra Franzenâ€™s tips(Opens in a new window) for giving the hiring manager something he or she canâ€™t resist.

Rule 5: Change it Up

If youâ€™re not connecting with someone, try changing it up. In other words, donâ€™t send the exact same email at the same time of day on the same day of week. Getting people to respond can sometimes just come down to catching them at the right time. If you always follow up in the morning, maybe try later in the day a few times.",4/5/2014 0:00,0.638418,3,11,1,5.741573,10,00000,0,11109.25,5207.44,8233.333,0.487179,0.124359,0.044944,0.033708,0.7,0.333333,3300

7030674,Gamification Engages Job Candidates Beyond Their Resumes,"Chances are, you don't think of gaming when you think of searching for a new job -- but gamification is somewhat of a burgeoning trend in some companies' hiring processes.

Gamification is an office empowerment tool that not only makes things more fun, but also increases engagement, commitment and motivation, as well as stimulates users, consumers and employees to go beyond their limits to truly understand something.

â€œStudies show that over 70% of employees are not engaged at work, and job applications have become more tedious then ever,â€ says Mario Herger(Opens in a new window), founder of Enterprise-Gamification.com(Opens in a new window) and a top 10 Leaderborded Gamification Guru(Opens in a new window). â€œWhen everything else has failed, businesses need to look at industries that successfully manage to engage their users. One of them is the game industry.â€

While it may seem somewhat out-of-the-box, companies that offer unique ways to showcase applicant skills and passions are actually giving job seekers the upper hand, as they no longer need put all their eggs in one basket and rely on a resume alone. Job seekers looking to work at innovative companies should consider embracing this creative hiring technique.

Showing off your skills by playing a game

This recent article(Opens in a new window) points out how emerging HR tech vendors have developed applications that enable companies to assess candidatesâ€™ skills based on how they perform on certain video games. Sadly, many experiments in this direction have failed, or have simply not met expectations.

As one example, Marriotâ€™s My Marriott Hotel Facebook game(Opens in a new window), a tool designed to recruit employees for the company's management program, disappointingly failed to generate any buzz. The game adopted FarmVilleâ€™s game concept, but shifted it into a hotel setting. Despite the various tasks the player could undertake, the game's features did not excite players enough to make the project a success.

Tech companies are leading the way

Some companies (and tech companies in particular) implement â€œchallenge-based recruitingâ€ to assess a candidate's ability to do a specific job and test their skills beyond video games and puzzles. These brands seem to rely less on resumes, embracing the ideas of best-selling author Seth Godin(Opens in a new window): â€œA resume is an excuse to reject you. Once you send me your resume, I can say, 'Oh, they're missing this or they're missing that,' and boom, you're out. A resume... begs for you to get a job as a cog in a giant machine,â€ writes Godin.

Tech companies have been challenging software engineers and developers to compete for jobs by showcasing their technical and creative skills. Google, for example, implemented â€œThe Google Code Jam(Opens in a new window),â€ a global online software-writing contest that attracts over 7,500 people each year. The top 25 finalists are invited to the Mountain View campus(Opens in a new window) to compete for $50,000 in prizes, as well as a chance to work at Google.

Opportunities for all industries

With tech industry jobs representing 5.4%(Opens in a new window) of the private sector workforce, one might think that the chance to showcase value -- no matter your academic background or years of experience -- is an option available only to a small percentage of the whole workforce. Good news for the remaining 94.6%: There are positions across all industries that are recruiting with these methods, from marketing interns to bankers, from store managers to sales associates.

â€œFor the first time, companies are not discriminating candidates based on their resumes; instead, employers can select the best people based on what they can bring to the table,"" says Joanna Weidenmiller(Opens in a new window), CEO and co-founder of 1-Page(Opens in a new window), a job proposal platform.

A unique way to pitch yourself

Innovative companies are making unique pitching tools(Opens in a new window) available to job seekers to help them stand out from the crowd and showcase their value to â€œwinâ€ a job (or at least an interview). Candidates can also access these platforms and work on unsolicited job proposals in order to frame their value proposition and, maybe one day, pitch the company of their dreams. Waiting for more companies to switch from resume-centric approaches to new and more engaging ways to assess candidates' value, job seekers can always play on the offense: Do your homework, find the challenges that your ideal company is facing, and propose a solution -- and don't forget to throw in why you are qualified, too. A well organized, straightforward and research-based job proposal adds more value than standard resumes.

7030721,Man With World's Strongest Memory Crusades Against Alzheimer's,"What does it take to have the best memory in the United States? Only four and a half years of training, for five hours each day, according to three-time national memory champ Nelson Dellis.

Dellis just won the 2014 USA Memory Championship(Opens in a new window) on March 29 in New York City, where he bested his own national record by recalling 310 digits in five minutes. He also set a new record in the process by memorizing 193 names and faces in 15 minutes.

[seealso slug=""emotional-arcade""]

And yet Dellis doesn't claim to have a photographic memory, or any other unusual brain powers besides extreme perseverance. In fact, he says anyone can do what he does.

""The [training] techniques are very simple, very learnable,"" he tells Mashable. ""The only thing I'm doing differently is that I'm training more.""

He details his not-so-secret training regime on his blog(Opens in a new window): seven decks of cards memorized each day, as well as a sequence of 360 random words, 600 names, 1,500 digits and 100 lines of poetry. That's more than one million bits of data memorized each year, by his own calculations.

Dellis' techniques, which were chronicled in the documentary Ben Franklin Blowing Bubbles at a Sword: The Journey of a Mental Athlete(Opens in a new window), also include associating numbers and cards with an action, person or object. He cobbles those images together as needed, which creates a distinct mental picture that facilitates memory.

A former software developer, Dellis was inspired to train his mind when doctors diagnosed his grandmother, Josephine, with Alzheimer's disease.

""I have this memory of sitting at a table having dinner with her, my grandfather and me. And she said, 'When is Nelson coming here?'"" Dellis told CNN(Opens in a new window) in 2012. ""I was sitting right in front of her... It never hit me like that.""

Dellis began researching mnemonic techniques online soon after, and eventually competed in the 2009 USA Memory Championships. He failed to place in the contest, however, so he refocused his energies on another passion -- mountain climbing. When his grandmother passed away later that year, Dellis decided to renew his efforts in memory training, and intertwine the two interests.

Never one to do things halfway -- ""I get very obsessive with things that I'm working on,"" he says -- mountain climbing would become a major part of his mission to honor his grandmother's memory.

He won his first Memory Championship in 2011, and repeated the victory the next year, when he also ranked seventh in the World Memory Championships(Opens in a new window). In the process, he broke two national records by memorizing a full deck of shuffled cards in 63 seconds and 303 digits in just five minutes. His training regimen reportedly(Opens in a new window) included memorizing a randomly shuffled deck of cards while climbing Mount Everest in 2011. (He was forced to turn back before reaching the summit due to problems with an oxygen mask.)

In 2012, Dellis founded Climb for Memory(Opens in a new window), a non-profit that raises funds for Alzheimer's awareness and research through mountain climbs, hoping the platform could garner attention for the cause. In 2013, memory software developer Fusion-io(Opens in a new window) sponsored Dellis' second try at climbing Everest, which ultimately failed due to aggressively inclement weather.

In 2015, Dellis will give Everest one final attempt. He'll also climb Nepal's Manaslu, the world's eighth-highest peak, later this year. In the meantime, he's trying his hand at starting a memory tournament of his own, dubbed the Extreme Memory Tournament(Opens in a new window), with a goal of making memory sport ""a lot more engaging for the audience,"" he says.

Taking place at the end of this month in San Diego, the tournament will feature a series of rapid-fire memorization events designed to ""break down every event into short, exciting, head-to-head memory battles."" Dellis has enlisted 16 of the world's best memory champions to compete, including the world's current top three mnemonists: Germany's Johannes Mallow and Simon Reinhard, and Sweden's Jonas von Essen.

Mental activities such as Dellis' techniques can help fight off(Opens in a new window) the effects of Alzheimer's, so even a little of his secret sauce goes a long way.

""My thinking is, when I'm older and starting to get a little weaker in my mind, knowing I have these memory techniques will help sharpen my mind and stave that off a little bit,"" he says.

But he isn't too worried about someone using his mnemonic roadmap to swoop in and claim his throne. ""I'm pretty confident that most people won't train that hard,"" he says. ""[But] I guess there will be someone eventually.""

7030781,Was Windows 8 a Mistake? Microsoft Seems to Think So,"Microsoft showed off the future of Windows this week at its 2014 Build developer conference, and it looks pretty retro. In fact, it looks a lot like Windows 7.

During a tease of some possible new features in a future update, Microsoft's executive vice-president of operating systems Terry Myerson revealed a tool that users will recognize from previous versions of Windows: a Start menu. He also showed that users would soon be able to run Modern -- aka ""Metro"" -- apps (those apps you buy in the Windows Store with touch-oriented full-screen interfaces) within individual windows on the desktop.

In other words, it's exactly how Windows used to work.

[seealso slug=""windows-8-problem""]

""Honestly I'm not really surprised,"" said one Build attendee, a developer from a major software company who didn't want to be named. ""The new UI hadn't really caught on. There was a lot of user backlash. And let's be honest: Metro apps aren't the biggest draw.""

Microsoft was going in this direction already. The latest Windows 8.1 Update reasserts some of the old-school desktop tools, such as the Windows taskbar, as well as buttons for close and minimize, which will now appear in Modern apps.

A new Start menu, along with windows for Modern apps, takes the Windows 8 retrograde to another level. It's tantamount to an admission from Microsoft that the approach it took with Windows 8 was a mistake; that tiled, touch-first interfaces simply don't work very well on traditional PCs like laptops.

That wasn't the party line when Microsoft debuted Windows 8 in the fall of 2012. At the time, the design philosophy implied desktop tools like the Start menu and taskbar were antiquated in an ever-connected world. And signposts such as permanent icons for power and search were simply unnecessary -- just noisy ""chrome"" that distracts you from whatever you happen to be doing.

That's dead wrong, according to user-experience designer Jesse James Garrett, chief creative officer of Adaptive Path(Opens in a new window), a design consulting firm. Garrett believes the whole approach of Windows 8 was broken from the start.

""It was just too different,"" he said. ""I think they made a lot of decisions that make complete sense if you're bringing a completely new tablet OS to market. But the PC experience is loaded with expectations that go back decades. That was completely up-ended by what they put in front of people.""

Killing the Start menu is probably the most revealing example of why Microsoft's approach irritated users. In Windows 8, the Start screen was intended to be a supercharged version of Start menu. Adapting it for touch, with smart, visual notifications in the form of live tiles, seemed like an idea that couldn't lose.

""The [Start menu] was a touchstone, an anchor you could always come back to,"" Garrett said. ""The Start screen isn't an obvious analog to the Start menu. It's visually so complex that people get lost. Without the anchor, it creates friction for users.""

Microsoft appears to have seen the error it made in merging a touch experience with a mouse-and-keyboard machine. It began to reverse course in Windows 8.1, bringing back the Start button (although it only served to return to the Start screen) and giving users the option to boot to the desktop.

With the 8.1 Update and the future changes Myerson showed, Microsoft is separating its conjoined OS twins even further. Windows, as a desktop interface, will be more or less back to normal (tablets will remain Modern-first).

""I think the initial idea to combine desktop and tablet was a mistake because it assumed that tablets would be the next evolution of the desktop,"" said Coty Beasley, a senior user-experience designer with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. ""That idea certainly didnâ€™t take hold in the way Microsoft was expecting.""

The Tablet Dilemma

Did it have to be this way? Why didn't Microsoft just launch Modern/Metro as a tablet-only OS, and leave the desktop well enough alone?

As a counterexample, Apple never tried to unite a tablet and desktop interface. CEO Tim Cook even famously compared the hybrid devices that resulted from such a pairing to ""refrigerator-toasters."" Some UI elements from iOS have made their way into OS X, but the iPad a decidedly different ecosystem from the Mac and OS X. This approach has worked out pretty well.

Microsoft was in a completely different market position, however. It wanted -- needed -- to jump-start its tablet platform, and it decided that leveraging the full power of the company's Windows developer base was the best way. Unfortunately, PC users were taken along for what ended up being a bumpy ride.

""I think the problem with Windows 8 all along has been that nothing about it was driven by user need,"" Garrett said. ""Donâ€™t get me wrong -- I think they did a great job in creating a touch UI, but coupling it with a legacy desktop didn't make sense.""

Microsoft's Windows 8 experiment wasn't necessarily a complete disaster. It hasn't helped PC sales, but it did generate developer interest in Modern apps, and it let Microsoft unite all of its consumer-facing platforms under a single standard called Universal Windows Apps. Now, if you develop for Windows, 90% of the code is the same when go from one kind of device to another, according to Steve Guggenheimer, Microsoft's vice-president of developer platform and evangelism.

Modern Age

However, if Microsoft keeps shrinking the presence of the Modern UI on desktop PCs -- the kinds of machines that constitute the vast majority of Windows devices on the market -- what incentive will there be for developers to keep working there?

""The big advantage on Metro now is you can re-use the code for mobile devices and platforms,"" said Alexander Kohler, a developer for Direct Mail House. ""I can address many more platforms now than I could before. Developing an app now isn't about Metro or not Metro. It's about, 'How many clients am I going to address?'""

Kohler is hinting at other side to the argument: If Modern apps will soon be able to run within windows, desktop users just might start downloading them. A few might even pay for the privilege.

""It seems people who use Windows 8 don't use Metro apps a ton,"" said Kellen Sunderland, who does development for Nokia and VideoLAN project, which makes the VLC player. ""So targeting mouse and keyboard users should drive up those adoption rates.""

Running Modern apps in a desktop window may be a tough sell for users. Modern Evernote, for example, is optimized for touch, with simplified tiles and icons -- just like you'd want on a tablet. It's difficult to see the advantage for a desktop user over, say, the web app.

Given those different experiences, once the Start menu is back and the desktop is king again, Microsoft may find itself back in the same position it was in before Windows 8: With a big desktop user base that sees little to no value in having a Windows tablet ecosystem present on their machines.

The troubled story of Windows 8 isn't over yet. It may still have a happy ending because it ultimately gave Microsoft a toehold in the tablet market. However, all the backpedalling exposes the folly of letting market strategy govern product development. Pleasing developers and breaking into new markets are important, but if they take hold of the process, they have a tendency to blur the end goal: Making products people actually want to use.",4/5/2014 0:00,0.612903,2,7,0,4.808917,7,00000,2976.577,9709.049,5914.909,592,0.573377,0.032045,0.025478,0.012739,0,0,3500

Stephen Colbert Is CBS' Top Choice to Succeed Letterman, and He's Into It | Mashable

When news leaked this week of David Letterman's retirement in 2015, the wild speculation began immediately.

7030785,iPhone-Friendly WTFJeans Protect You From Water and Radiation,"Four years after it launched its first iPhone-friendly jeans, Zagreb, Croatia-based startup WTFJeans has ""upgraded"" its product to version 3.

The main feature of WTFJeans 3 is still a microfiber-lined, iPhone-friendly pocket. The pockets (there are two) are optimized for the iPhone 4, 4S, 5 and 5S and it cleans your device's screen as you pull it out.

SEE ALSO: Guess How Many Gadgets Are in This Jacket

The biggest improvement is something that the project's founder, Pedja Puselja, claims hasn't been done in the world of gadget-friendly jeans: WTFJeans 3 are coated with a nano-layer that protects the jeans (and the iPhone inside them) from light rain and spills. It also holds other liquids at bay, including wine and oil, protecting -- to a degree -- your jeans from getting dirty.

Puselja is visibly excited as he pours water over the WTFJeans 3 prototype -- which, interestingly enough, are designed in Croatia but manufactured in Serbia -- and the water just slides from the jeans, leaving only the slightest wet stains.

""I have no idea why the big brands aren't doing this. As a gadget lover, I just want to improve the jeans -- that's why we're adding all these features.""

We've had some hands-on time with the WTFJeans 3, and we can attest that the nanocoating tech really works, as you can see in the short video below. The nano-protection is at its best with small amounts of water, and it depends whether you pour it on a smooth part of the jean or a crumpled one -- the latter will yield much worse results. As such, it definitely won't protect your jeans from heavy rain, and if you throw them into water, Puselja admits, they will get wet. But, a few drops of liquid will simply roll off the jeans like it would from a water-resistant tent fabric.

It doesn't last forever, though. Mr. Puselja claims the water-repellant coating will withstand 20 to 40 washes; we had no way to test that out, so you'll have to take his word for it.

There are other nifty features; for example, one pocket now comes with a copper-based radiation shield, which you can place between the iPhone and your body. The actual health-benefits of such protection are outside the scope of this article, but the copper-mesh material used in WTFJeans should definitely block the kind of radiation a cellphone would emit.

A question that immediately pops up is compatibility with other devices. Unfortunately, owners of 5-inch and larger Android devices likely won't be able to stuff their smartphone in the quite narrow pocket.

""I'm an iPhone user, and I wanted to associate the WTFJeans brand primarily with the iPhone,"" Puselja tells us. ""Perhaps in the future we will consider other models, but for now we're only officially supporting the iPhone.""

Another issue that potentially clouds the project is the fate of the original WTFJeans. After seeing initial success in pre-orders, Puselja had his funds locked down by PayPal due to breach of PayPal's TOS, which at the time did not allow for very early pre-orders. ""What's done is done,"" said Puselja. ""We did what we could to refund each and every customer the first time around. This is a different company now; only the brand is the same. We don't handle payments through PayPal anymore, and we're certain the same issues will not happen again.""

7030794,"Google to Launch Android TV, Report Says","Just a few days after Amazon unveiled the Fire TV, Google will reportedly launch its own set-top box.

The Mountain View, Calif. company is close to debuting Android TV, an Android-powered platform that will compete directly with the Fire TV, Apple TV and Roku. Google will still sell its Chromecast device, a $35 dongle that plugs into any HDTV to let you watch online videos from your tablet, smartphone or computer, according to The Verge(Opens in a new window).

Video app providers are currently working hard to build for Android TV. The device will also be compatible with gaming, and come with an optional gaming controller, much like the Fire TV.

Documents obtained by The Verge outline a simpler approach than Google TV, which launched in 2010, and aimed to turn TV sets into larger versions of smartphones.

""Android TV is an entertainment interface, not a computing platform,"" the document said. ""Itâ€™s all about finding and enjoying content with the least amount of friction."" It will be ""cinematic, fun, fluid, and fast.""

Android TV will support voice commands (like the Fire TV), and focus on finding content quickly. The document describes how it shouldn't take more than three clicks to go from the home screen to watching content. ""Access to content should be simple and magical,"" it said.

The interface will include ""cards"" for each movie, show, app and games -- all sitting on a virtual shelf -- and users will be able to access a remote control to navigate through the content. Screenshots of Android TV show Google apps such as YouTube and Hangouts included on the platform, as well as outside services such as Hulu, Netflix and Pandora.

The news follows reports that the company is in talks to launch its own wireless service in regions where it already offers Google Fiber Internet and TV service. Considering that Google already dominates with its search engine and Android mobile operating system, it's a natural (yet ambitious) step for the company to try to keep all mobile communications within its ecosystem.

Kendrick, as the leg-coveting Ariel, covers Kesha, Britney Spears and Selena Gomez in an attempt to demonstrate the dry-land humans' preferred taste in music. But even mermaid BFFs Sebastian and Flounder can't support Ariel's new sound.

But Ariel wasn't the only Disney princess Kendrick channeled while hosting SNL. She opened the show with a monologue ripped straight from the pages of Belle's book.

â€œI got my start in musical theatre. When I was 10, my dad took me to see Beauty and the Beast on Broadway, and I just knew I wanted to be up there, so to be here on this New York stage is so incredibly exciting. It just feels like something out of a storybook,â€ Kendrick said before breaking into song.

Kristoffer Von Hassel discovered a security flaw with Microsoft's Xbox One that allowed him to log into his father's account.

SEE ALSO: SmartGlass Is Now a Universal Remote for Xbox One

Kristoffer's father, Robert Davies, started noticing that Kristoffer was logging into his Xbox Live account and playing video games that were off-limits. When prompted to enter a password, Kristoffer would enter a series of spaces and hit enter, gaining access to his father's account.

""I was like yea!"" Kristoffer told KGTV-10(Opens in a new window), a CNN affiliate, after breaking into his dad's account.

Glee quickly turned into panic as the thought of his father finding out what he did dawned upon Kristoffer. Instead, Davies was interested, as he himself works in online security.

""How awesome is that?"" Davies said. ""Just being five years old and being able to find a vulnerability and latch on to that. I thought that was pretty cool.""

After Kristoffer showed his father what he did, Davies reported the issue to Microsoft.

""We're always listening to our customers and thank them for bringing issues to our attention,"" Microsoft said in a statement to KGTV-10. ""We take security seriously at Xbox and fixed the issue as soon as we learned about it.""

According to KGTV-10, Microsoft will give Kristoffer four games, a $50 gift card and a year-long subscription of Xbox Live.

Hundreds of enthusiasts played the classic video game on the 29-story Cira Centre high-rise building in downtown Philadelphia Saturday, possibly setting a world record in the process.

[seealso slug=""a-cappella-tetris""]

Colorful displays appear on the 437-foot building during any normal night thanks to hundreds of LED lights installed on its facade, but this weekend, the Cira Centre's north and south sides were turned into a 100,000-square-foot screen, while players controlled larger than life pieces with joysticks.

This year's event follows a record-breaking(Opens in a new window) game of Pong played on the same building last year.

""This project began as a personal love letter to the games that I loved as a child -- Pong last year, Tetris this year,"" Frank Lee, an associate professor at Drexel University who organized the massive game, told onlookers, according to the Associated Press(Opens in a new window). ""But it ended up as a way of uniting the city of Philadelphia.""

Players entered a lottery(Opens in a new window) for a chance to play on the colossal screen. Competitors on each side of the building played against each other, and also worked together in a more cooperative version, according to Drexel University(Opens in a new window).

The game was a part of Philly Tech Week(Opens in a new window), a week-long event celebrating technology and innovation, which officially kicked off Friday.

Tetris, the brainchild of Russian computer programmer Alexey Pajitnov, celebrates its 30th anniversary this June. Among the spectators at Saturday's event was game designer Henk Rogers, the man credited with bringing Tetris to Nintendo's Game Boy in the late 1980s, a move that popularized the game, the AP reported.

Officers arrested 18 people during the disturbance, while nearly 30 were taken to the hospital.

After the initial incident, the violence escalated. A large crowd amassed over several blocks and threw rocks, bricks and other objects at officers. At least five more officers were injured during the disturbance. One took a blow to the face from a brick and two others were hit on their hands with bottles. All of the injured officers were released from the hospital Sunday morning, the Associated Press(Opens in a new window) reports.

Tear gas and foam projectiles were used to handle the crowd, which also tore stop signs out of the ground, ignited small fires and damaged law enforcement vehicles.

Warner Bros. and Legendary Pictures have done a masterful job of teasing out the ""destroyer of worlds,"" starting with our first look at the big fella's handiwork at Comic-Con 2012. I remember it well:

Godzilla frightened me. Seriously frightened me. All that destruction. All of those ... people. #SDCC(Opens in a new window)

â€” Josh Lincoln Dickey (@NotoriousJLD) July 14, 2012(Opens in a new window)

That sizzle reel showed us virtually nothing of the monster himself, yet was incredibly effective. More than a year later, the first trailer offered a goose-bump-raising glimpse; but its magic was not in its CGI monstrosity, rather the palpable terror of its people -- and their fear is contagious. Although the marketing blitz is on, this film is sticking to the plan: Make the characters look good, too.

It helps to have Breaking Bad star Bryan Cranston around to draw us into a world where a radioactive kaiju is laying waste to wide swaths of a city and its citizens with every step. Cranston brings the incomprehensible scale down to an emotional level, destroying us with his deadly gravitas. (He's so good that you almost don't hear the disaster-movie clichÃ© horn blasts with every beat.)

So what was new in this weekend's trailer release? Plenty. We took screenshots of the best of it for you:

Headlined by Rose's name above the word ""parasite,"" the flyer also includes an odd smiley face graphic and read, in part:

As a partner venture capitalist at Google Ventures, Kevin directs the flow of capital from Google into the tech startup bubble that is destroying San Francisco. The start-ups that he funds bring the swarms of young entrepreneurs that have ravaged the landscapes of San Francisco and Oakland.

With each new tech corporation comes a wave of fresh techies, who on average earn four times more than a normal service worker. We are the ones who serve them coffee, deliver them food... watch their kids, and mop their floors. Nearly all of them are just like Kevin Rose and we are tired of this miserable and untenable situation.

According to Rose, the protesters also recorded video of their actions and promised to upload the footage to YouTube.

This latest protest against Rose, which has yet to be claimed by any particular group of individuals, is the most high profile of a series of actions taken in recent months against Google employee shuttle buses.

Like the Rose incident, the previous Google shuttle bus protests have focused on the Bay Area's technology boom as a factor in accelerating gentrification and the displacement of lower-income residents.

In a related development, on Wednesday, local officials upheld a decision to charge technology company commuter shuttle buses a fee for using public bus stops in San Francisco.

However, as the local tech boom continues apace, the tensions between major tech brands in the area and protesters appear likely to continue.

But despite the protest landing on his own doorstep, Rose seemed to take the incident in stride, posting his thoughts about the action on Twitter.

7030635,HBO's 'Silicon Valley' Is a Nerdy 'Entourage' Nailing Tech Culture,"""God, I hate Palo Alto,"" an exotic dancer exclaims inside a house full of awkward tech nerds during an episode of HBO's Silicon Valley, which debuts Sunday at 10 p.m. ET -- an ideal time slot after the Game of Thrones season four premiere.

But for all of the things that this frustrated dancer hates about Silicon Valley, you'll likely find them enjoyable while watching the new half-hour satirical comedy, as the series doesn't hold back mocking the area's burgeoning startup culture. The sitcom was somewhat inspired by co-creator Mike Judge -- the mastermind behind King of the Hill, Beavis and Butt-head and Office Space -- who worked begrudgingly at a Silicon Valley startup in the 1980s.

[seealso slug=""silicon-valley-obsessed-hbo-silicon-valley""]

""It's like Asperger's Entourage,"" T.J. Miller, who plays self-indulgent dotcom millionaire Erlich, told Mashable. ""Weâ€™ve taken great pains to make it as real as possible, not only in the fact-checking but also in the texture and the characters of Silicon Valley.""

The show follows introverted programmer Richard (played by Thomas Middleditch) and focuses on his compression algorithm hidden within his music site called Pied Piper. As soon as his employer Hooli, a tech company with eerily similar characteristics to what moviegoers saw about Google in last year's The Internship, and a venture capitalist discover the valuable algorithm, a bidding war emerges.

The fictitious battle to snatch up quality products and people is reminiscent of what's happening in the real world, with Facebook recently acquiring Oculus Rift maker Oculus VR and messaging app WhatsApp, just to name a few acquisitions in 2014.

Silicon Valley gives us a satirical behind-the-scenes look at these big financial dealings as well as the mindsets of every player involved in such eye-popping transactions.

""Mike Judge is a genius,"" said Kumail Nanjiani, who plays Richard's arrogant yet insecure colleague Dinesh. ""Heâ€™s really good at getting into subcultures â€” like the culture of the office or the politics of very specific worlds. He nails a lot of it.""

Judge infuses the series with cameos and references to actual tech behemoths. In the premiere episode, Google chairman Eric Schmidt makes an appearance at an expensive yet stale launch party, at one point ignoring an inevitable sales pitch. Apple co-founders Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak also get name-dropped in the show's first trailer.

Middleditch hopes viewers, after seeing the season's eight episodes, ""think itâ€™s a funny comedy that has a rewarding story,"" he told Mashable after riding a wrecking ball and holding Grumpy Cat at SXSW in March.

Massachusetts Institute of Technology researchers are developing ""living materials""(Opens in a new window) from biological particles that could be used in everyday items.

""We are trying to make living materials compared, so people could use them instead of the non-living materials that are popular today,"" Timothy Lu, associate professor at MIT, told Mashable. ""We want to leverage the ability of biology. With things such as trees and bone are materials made without human intervention, we want to grow similar materials from the ground up.""

Lu believes this method would be more environmentally friendly and require less energy from robots building things in factories.

The researchers recently completed a proof of concept that was meant to be a first step towards the creation of 'living materials' or cell-based factories for materials.

""We modified E. coli bacteria to form biofilms and engineered them to contain artificial genetic programs that allowed us to control the materials they made by adding external chemicals,"" Lu said. ""By changing when and where we added these chemicals, we were able to create biofilms that formed different materials.""

The researchers also designed bacteria that could talk to each other and coordinate the formation of different materials, without human input.

""Using this platform, we made biofilms that could bind to gold nanoparticles to conduct electricity or to bind to quantum dots and emit fluorescence,"" he added.

However, there are many challenges standing in the way of using this in everyday items.

""We are still technologically far away from this becoming a reality, but we could see it in the next five to 10 years,"" Lu said. ""There are also regulatory issues and society ones too -- people might not be quick to adopt something like this. If we could use live cells to grow the material and then remove those cells from the final product, I think more people would be willing to give it a try.""",4/6/2014 0:00,0.524957,6,2,0,4.409917,7,Entertainment,0,5354.572,3307.874,3550,0.384762,0.223438,0.052893,0.009917,0.4,-0.2,1600

""The set uses 3D projection mapping and adds layered depth of field perception and animated graphic content,â€ an Audi spokesperson told Mashable.

7026496,"Mickey Rooney, Star of the Screen, Stage and TV for Decades, Dead at 93","Mickey Rooney, the diminutive triple-threat entertainer who was a major film and TV star from the time he was a teen -- and whose showbiz career spanned every decade of his long life going back to the 1920s -- has died, according to multiple media reports. He was 93.

Rooney packed more talent into his 5â€™2â€ frame than most of his contemporaries, even at a time when singing and dancing were a regular part of the acting life. He also played instruments, switched seamlessly between comedy and drama and was nominated for four Academy Awards, taking home two honorary Oscars â€“- a â€œJuvenileâ€ award in 1939 and another for his body of work in 1983.

Despite being a highly successful child actor, Rooney managed to avoid the kind of personal tragedy that comes along with it â€¦ mostly. He was married eight times, filed for bankruptcy in 1962, and struggled to shake off his boyish persona after serving in the Army from 1944 to 1946, a tour he spent primarily traveling the world and entertaining the troops abroad.

Rooney's final years saw their share of familial strife, too. He accused stepson Chris Aber of elder abuse and stealing money, winning a $2.8 million judgment against him just last year.

Rooney was part of his familyâ€™s Vaudeville stage act from the time he was a toddler, and scored his first Hollywood roles as a young child in short films. But his first real break came when MGM cast him as the comic relief character Andy Hardy in A Family Affair, which was supposed to be a B-movie one-off.

It was a hit -â€“ and Rooney was the reason. He and the studio made 13 more Andy Hardy films between then and 1946, with a final film in 1958.

Rooney was the first teen Oscar nominee for his lead role in 1940's Strike Up the Band, the same year he starred alongside Elizabeth Taylor in National Velvet -- her breakout role. Rooney appeared with nearly every iconic leading lady of his era; he was a close friend to Judy Garland, starred with Audrey Hepburn in Breakfast at Tiffany's and was once married to Ava Gardner.

Rooney was a major part of MGMâ€™s talent stable in the â€˜30s and â€˜40s, and after his Army service the studio tried to refashion his image as a leading man -- but it never quite worked on post-war audiences.

[seealso slug=""mickey-rooney-movie-moments""]

Still, Rooney never struggled to find work. He appeared in several films, television series and made-for-TV movies, winning an Emmy for his touching portrayal of a mentally challenged man attempting to strike out on his own in 1981â€™s Bill.

Rooney continued to work well into his advanced age â€“- he was in post-production on a movie version of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde at the time of his death, and made a cameo in Disneyâ€™s 2011 reboot of The Muppets.

Mashable's calls and emails to Rooney's professional representation were not immediately returned Sunday night. His death was first reported by TMZ(Opens in a new window).

He is survived by nine children and 19 grandchildren.

7010580,Ukraine Faces New Crisis as Pro-Russian Separatists Seize Buildings,"A new crisis began brewing for Ukraine on Sunday as pro-Russian separatists stormed government buildings in three eastern Ukrainian cities, demanding referendums on joining Russia.

Acting President Oleksandr Turchynov canceled a trip to Lithuania and called an emergency session with heads of the countryâ€™s security services.

A group of masked pro-Russian men in Donetsk, carrying sticks and stones, split off from a separatist rally being held at the cityâ€™s main Lenin Square and forced their way inside the regional government building, smashing windows and breaking through doors, local media reported.

Police reportedly brought a water cannon to the building, but did not use it against the protesters, who issued an ultimatum to local authorities: call an emergency session of the regional council before midnight, or they will be replaced by a â€œpeopleâ€™s council.â€

In nearby Luhansk, more than 200 protesters demanding the release of 15 pro-Russian activists arrested earlier in the week clashed with police who reportedly used tear gas to try to stop them from seizing the local security service building. But the police efforts were unsuccessful, as several in the mob still managed to break down the buildingâ€™s door while others pelted its windows with stones and eggs, according to an AFP reporter on the ground.

At least one police officer and a demonstrator were reportedly injured in the skirmish.

Luhanskâ€™s regional governor reportedly entered the building later to try to negotiate with the pro-Russian crowd, encouraging them to turn themselves over to police, but to no avail.

Meanwhile, a pro-Russian crowd of some 2,000 people gathered in Kharkiv to demand that a referendum be held there. Late in the evening several of the protesters stormed the regional government building in the center of the city and raised the Russian flag atop it.

On Facebook, Ukrainian Interior Minister Arsen Avakov charged Russian President Vladimir Putin and deposed Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych of â€œinstigating and paying for the new wave of separatist riots(Opens in a new window).â€

Of those involved in the seizure of the buildings in Donetsk, he said: â€œThere aren't many people, but the aggression is over the top. In Donetsk, to the crowd of those who stormed the building a lot of women and children were brought in. They're provoking a bloody conflict with victims.â€

Orders have been given to the police in the beleaguered cities to quell the unrest â€œwith no bloodshed,â€ he said, adding that those caused it will bear legal responsibility for their actions.

â€œA cruel approach will be used to everyone who directly conducts attacks on state buildings, on law enforcers and other civilians,â€ he warned.

Turchynov's press service reportedly said the acting president had called an emergency meeting(Opens in a new window) with security officials in his office and took â€œpersonal controlâ€ over the escalating situation.

The turmoil comes mere weeks after Moscow seized and annexed the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea, returning it to Russia after more than six decades as part of Ukraine.

At the same time, there is concern that Putin may order his troops into the eastern regions of Ukraine under the same pretext he used to invade Crimea: ethnic Russians must be â€œprotected"" from â€œneo-Nazis and fascistsâ€ in Kiev who seized power in late February through a Western-backed coup dâ€™Ã©tat.

Over the past few weeks, tens of thousands of Russian troops have amassed on Ukraineâ€™s borders and carried out war games.

The U.S. has said that Russia has placed about 40,000 soldiers near the eastern border of Ukraine, while the Kiev government estimates some 100,000 are mere miles from the countryâ€™s boundaries on all sides.

Moscow has denied that it plans to move its troops beyond Crimea and into mainland Ukraine, but its troops have not retreated from their positions at Russiaâ€™s western border.

Former Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili wrote on Facebook amid the chaos on Sunday that what is happening in eastern Ukraine resembles the Russian moves in Crimea(Opens in a new window). He said he believes that the pro-Russian separatists will try to hold the building for three days, allowing Putin time to prepare his troops to enter Ukraine under the pretense that Kiev is not in control of the country and cannot defend Moscowâ€™s compatriots there.

With their head government office overtaken by the masked pro-Russian separatists, some citizens of Donetsk reportedly penned an open letter(Opens in a new window) to Turchynov, asking for the Ukrainian governmentâ€™s help to ensure their safety.

â€œWe ask you, using all the available means and human resources and power to take immediate measures to ensure the safety of residents of Donetsk region, to create conditions for the rights and freedoms of the people of the region, and personally oversee the performance of law-enforcement agencies of their functions and enforcement of protection of interests of Ukraine,â€ reads the letter.",4/6/2014 0:00,0.433798,8,2,0,4.136797,3,Entertainment,3242.084,3744.634,3518.601,1700,0.549721,0.129721,0.044156,0.02684,0.366667,-0.225,1700

7030264,Why Another Old White Guy Is a Bad Idea for CBS' 'Late Show',"A little background on me in regards to late-night talk shows: I wrote for the pilot for The Pete Holmes Show, previously wrote for @midnight with Chris Hardwick, and attended tapings of Jimmy Kimmel Live! and Conan. I also made this hilarious and perfect tweet that was cited by the pinnacle of journalism, Time magazine(Opens in a new window) (wherein I was also adorably mentioned in a sentence along with the word ""moxie""):

Credit:

Besides all that, I'm the audience CBS wants. I'm the millennial it -- and everyone else -- seems so desperate to ensnare.

The odds are I don't have the same relationship with late-night television that you do. If you've ever stayed up too late to watch Johnny Carson without your parents knowing, or sneakily recorded a David Letterman bit on your VCR, or always ended your workday next to your partner in bed while watching Jay Leno ask, ""If you've seen"" this or ""If you've heard about"" that, I can't pretend to have the same relationship with late night as you. I can't and I won't.

As someone born after 1990, I've always had the luxury of accessibility: TIVO-ing programs and watching them at 3 in the afternoon the next day, creating my own custom late-night lineups. I can shotgun a week's worth of Conan on Saturday when I'm tired, and want to catch up on the shows I missed. I can then go online, and pick and choose the pieces of content that I want to see. I can watch clips from late-night shows in 1957, or from last night's The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.

It's easy to write off this behavior in me and my peers as ADD, but the truth is we have taste, we are picky and we don't have to put up with anything if we don't want to.

It seems the way executives have chosen to address the problem of my generation is to try and ""youth-anize"" (not proud of that) their programs, as if we watch a video of a goat screaming because it's on YouTube -- rather than the fact that it's just solid comedy. I won't lie: Some of the old late-night formats bore me; I don't have the luxury of nostalgia to help me think fondly of them. There's a reason why ""Take my wife, please(Opens in a new window)"" (and its Kazakistan equivalent ""My wiiiife"") were only funny the first 100 times or so: Comedy gets stale.

But newer, flashier gimmicks can feel equally off-putting; they're jarring and uncomfortable. It seems every program wants to be ""DIFFERENT"" and ""SHAKE THINGS UP,"" but the truth is that adding a segment on GIFs isn't going to cut it. All we want is something new, and we want something good. That's why I'm imploring CBS: Please, please, don't make the new Late Show host a white dude.

Don't get me wrong: Gender or race aren't going to make me tune in every week because of novelty. But the chance to hear a different set of opinions, tastes and a worldview I'm not bombarded with every single day is exciting! It makes me want to tune in! And there are millions of people who don't identify with white-male hosts anymore, and -- crazily enough -- they also have the internet. CBS would be shooting itself in the foot if it pretended they're not there.

If late-night television is supposed to set the tone for our nation's conversation, then all we're getting right now is a lot of white noise. And it'd be nice to change the dial.

My Picks for the Next Late Show Host

Wyatt Cenac

Cenac has already proved himself a capable correspondent on The Daily Show(Opens in a new window), producing some of my favorite segments for the program. But before that, he was an accomplished sketch performer and writer, as well as a standup comedian (his special ""Comedy Person"" aired in May 2011 on Comedy Central). Cenac also has a calmness and self-assuredness about him that could anchor a show.

Hari Kondabolu

I really enjoy Kondabolu(Opens in a new window)'s standup -- he just released his album Waiting for 2042 -- but what's notable is how strong and sharp his voice is already. With stories like the time a woman cut in front of him at the airport because she thought his father was a cabbie (despite not driving, you know, a cab) Kondabolu would provide a breath of fresh air to the late-night scene.

Cameron Esposito

A Chicago native, Esposito is a killer standup comic with biting wit, but also treats everyone she encounters with respect and candor. Coming off a tour with Anthony Jeselnik(Opens in a new window), she recently appeared on The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson(Opens in a new window) where the other guest was none other than Jay Leno.

Keegan-Michael Key

Half of the duo on Comedy Central show Key and Peele, Key and partner Jordan Peele set, and then raised a whole new bar for television sketch comedy (U.S. President Barack Obama officially gave it the thumbs up when he appeared on The Tonight Show). In addition to being an amazing sketch writer and performer, Key is also just as comfortable on stage or in a one-on-one conversation. I've been lucky enough to talk with him a few times, and on each occasion, he went out of his way to make me feel comfortable and at ease -- the best trait we can ask for in a host.

â€¦Although, if I'm being honest, I'd happily watch Peele host every night, too. Whereas some late-night hosts can be boisterous, Peele always seems to be in control of any situation, in the most comforting way possible.

Nicole Byer

On the more youthful side, Byer has the ability to hold her own alongside comedy elders. Her web series Pursuit of Sexiness, which she created with Saturday Night Live cast member Sasheer Zamata, stands out among the pack. She's also a breakout star of MTV's Girl Code. Plus, as an Upright Citizens Brigade(Opens in a new window) alum, she's more than comfortable performing live.

I love Jack Parr and Conan O'Brien and yes, I obviously love David Letterman. I love a solid format and a comforting presence to end my day with, and I think America does, too. So, CBS, I'm not asking that you reinvent late night -- in fact, please don't. Just maybe get someone new behind the desk.

7030359,Child's Portrait Puts a Face on Drone Strikes in Pakistan,"A drone pilot can sit in a room thousands of miles away from his targets, looking at the world through the prism of the flying robot's camera, which itself is hovering hundreds of feet away from the drone's potential victims. In those circumstances, war is dehumanized: the pilot can't see the face of his victims.

An artist collective from Pakistan, France and the United States wants to change that with a giant poster of a young child visible from the sky. The group installed it in an unnamed town in Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) province, close to the Northwest border with Afghanistan, an area regularly targeted by drone strikes.

The idea is to raise awareness of civilian deaths caused by drone strikes and perhaps make a pilot think twice before pressing the button.

""Now, when viewed by a drone camera, what an operator sees on his screen is not an anonymous dot on the landscape, but an innocent child victimâ€™s face,"" the artists wrote in the project's website(Opens in a new window).

The collective named the project #NotABugSplat after the way some drone operators refer to their victims: ""bug splats."" That's the military slang for drone victims, since ""viewing the body through a grainy-green video image gives the sense of an insect being crushed,"" according to a 2012 Rolling Stone(Opens in a new window) article.

Human rights organization Reprieve UK and the Foundation for Fundamental Rights also collaborated in the project.

Saks Afridi, a member for the artist collective, told Mashable that the group would rather not disclose the identity of its members since some of them are in Pakistan.

""Weâ€™re a little apprehensive about giving all our names out for the time being,"" he said in an email.

The name of the child depicted in the poster is unknown, but according to the project's site, the Foundation for Fundamental Rights said she lost both her parents and two young siblings in a strike where she was wounded.

Afridi also declined to disclose the exact name of the town where the giant poster of the child was placed, but said they installed it in May with the help of the locals.

The artist collective hopes to do ""a dozen more"" installations like these in the future, according to Afridi.

It's unclear how many people have been killed in U.S. drone strikes around the world or Pakistan, as no official statistics have been released. But the Bureau of Investigative Journalism estimates(Opens in a new window) that since 2004, there have been between 2,296 and 3,718 people killed in Pakistan. Of those, between 416 and 957 are civilians, and between 168 and 202 are children.

This is not the first time activists have used unusual means to raise awareness about the drone war.

7010407,'Battlestar Galactica' Reboot Heading to the Big Screen: Report,"Good news, Battlestar Galactica fans: Universal is resurrecting plans for a film reimagining of the sci-fi franchise.

The project will be produced by series creator Glen Larson, according to Variety(Opens in a new window).

[seealso slug= ""battlestar-galactica-viper-simulator""]

Battlestar Galactica previously had two lives on television. The first was in an ABC series that lasted from 1978 to 1979(Opens in a new window); the show, while low-rated, developed a cult following. In 2003, Ronald D. Moore and David Eick reimagined Battlestar Galactica as a three-hour miniseries(Opens in a new window); its success led to an acclaimed sci-fi series that ran from 2004 to 2009(Opens in a new window).

In Battlestar Galactica, humans (living on planets known as the Twelve Colonies) are engaged in a war against the Cylons, a cybernetic race that wants to exterminate the human race. A major attack devastates the Colonies, and leaves only one ship in the Colonial battle fleet -- the Battlestar Galactica -- intact. The survivors go off in search of a fabled thirteenth colony known as Earth.

Rumors of a Battlestar Galactica film have persisted for years, including speculation in 2009 that Bryan Singer was attached to direct. John Orloff was hired to write a script in 2011, according to Deadline(Opens in a new window).

The latest writer attached to the project is Jack Paglen. Paglen is also writing the screenplay for the Prometheus sequel, which starts shooting this fall, Variety reported.

Rather than using characteristics from the 1978 or 2004 series, the new film is supposed to be another reboot of the Battlestar Galactica world, but with a similar premise. The original plan back in 2009 was to keep characters such as Apollo, Starbuck and Baltar, albeit with different actors (and potentially different genders).",4/7/2014 0:00,0.691358,3,1,1,4.169697,6,Social Media,2381.146,6536.429,3715.109,2000,0.446795,0.099359,0.030303,0.024242,0,0,1700

7030334,'Captain America: The Winter Soldier': 9 Key Details You May Have Missed,"Every week, Mashable presents â€œLetâ€™s Talk About â€¦,â€ a Monday-morning look back at the biggest, buzziest WTF moments from the weekendâ€™s most talked-about new movies in wide release. If you havenâ€™t seen the film, be warned: This doesnâ€™t just contain spoilers â€” it is spoilers.

Judging by its $96 million domestic opening -- the biggest April movie of all time -- many of you caught Captain America: The Winter Soldier this weekend. But did you really catch everything?

The film dumped a helicarrier-load of new characters, fan easter eggs and hints at whatâ€™s to come as Marvel wraps up Phase Two, loosely defined as all the films after The Avengers up to and including Avengers: Age of Ultron. Winter Soldier laid a lot of foundation for future Marvel films -- just like Marvel honcho Kevin Feige said it would.

Here are the nine Winter Soldier moments and new characters youâ€™ll need to keep top of mind while looking forward to next May, when the menace of Ultron reunites Earthâ€™s Mightiest Heroes.

Steve Rogers is now in charge -- as it should be

[img src=""http://admin.mashable.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/cap.leads_.jpg"" caption=""A scene from ""The Avengers."""" credit="""" alt=""cap.leads""]

What happened: â€œLooks like youâ€™re giving the orders now, Cap,â€ says a broken and battered Nick Fury, after taking advantage of a brutal attack to stage his own death. Heâ€™s been revoked of his S.H.I.E.L.D. command because, well â€¦ the whole organization collapsed under the weight of Hydra corruption.

Why itâ€™s important: This is a major turning point in the films, but really, itâ€™s just squaring things up with the comic books: For years, Captain America has been the leader of the Avengers. His role is really more master strategist and infallible human-resources department than tactical combatant. Look for Cap to take a major step up when the Avengers re-assemble.

Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver are here!

[img src=""http://admin.mashable.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/scarlet.witch_.jpg"" caption=""Elizabeth Olsen plays the Scarlet Witch in ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"""" credit=""Getty Images"" alt=""Elizabeth Olsen""]

What happened: The Winter Soldier post-credits easter egg gave us a first look at Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and the Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen). â€œThe Twins,â€ theyâ€™re called by their evil captor.

Why itâ€™s important: The Scarlet Witch has the overarching ability to bend reality with her mind. When youâ€™re dealing with a bad guy as powerful as the malevolent artificial intelligence Ultron, you need more than just wits and the ability to bash things. Ultron is so tough that the original movie Avengers wouldnâ€™t have a prayer; they need an ally with more cosmic clout. We even caught a glimpse of the Witch (real name: Wanda Maximoff) doing battle with Ultron in those first leaked set photos (above). As for Quicksilver, well â€¦ heâ€™s her brother. Heâ€™s just really fast, mostly, but they kind of go hand-in-hand.

Stephen Strange is lurking somewhere, too

What happened: Nothing more than a name-drop in the second act.

Why itâ€™s important: The Sorcerer Supreme is like Scarlet Witch in that his powers go beyond hammering and smashing and blasting; heâ€™s got some mystical interdimensional mojo. The Avengers are going to need more like him. But is he getting his own movie? Magic 8 Ball says: Concentrate and ask again.

Arnim Zola Has an out-of-body experience

[img src=""http://admin.mashable.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Arnim.zola_.jpg"" caption=""Toby Jones plays Arnim Zola in ""Captain America: The First Avenger."""" credit="""" alt=""Arnim.zola""]

What happened: Toby Jonesâ€™ character was introduced in the first Captain America, but as a bit of a throwaway; he was the Red Skullâ€™s lackey and nothing more. In Winter Soldier we see him more as he is in the comics: A worthy standalone adversary, who has transferred his intelligence into an artificial shell â€“ in this case, a bank of aging computer servers.

Why itâ€™s important: Zola is portrayed as Hydra-loyal, but with his bioengineering background and freedom from a physical body, hereâ€™s betting he pops up again and again. Judging by the nature of his evil plan in Winter Soldier, he might even be the missing link in the creation of Ultron himself.

Baron Wolfgang von Strucker, rhymes with â€¦

Thomas Kretschmann, who plays Wolfgang Baron Von Strucker Credit: Franziska Krug

What happened: In the first post-credits scene, we see Von Strucker showing off the same weapon Loki used to subdue the Earth in The Avengers, as well as Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch in captivity.

Why itâ€™s important: Von Strucker is a lesser villain in the Marvel universe, but they didnâ€™t hire veteran German actor Thomas Kretschmann (above) just to film the post-credits Easter Egg. Judging solely by what heâ€™s got in his arsenal, Hydra leader will be a factor in Ultron -- somehow.

Crossbones (Brock Lumrow) is born

[img src=""http://admin.mashable.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Grillo.png"" caption=""Frank Grillo plays Brock Lumrow in ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier."""" credit="""" alt=""Grillo""]

What happened: Frank Grillo spends Winter Soldier tracking down Cap and trying to subdue him. His mission ends in extreme pain, but heâ€™s alive -- and fans of the comics know the duplicitous S.H.I.E.L.D. agent is the alter-ego of Crossbones, a vile nemesis of Steve Rogers.

Why itâ€™s important: He may not be in Ultron, but his presence signifies a potential Captain America 3 storyline. Especially because heâ€™s aligned with the Red Skull. Which brings us to â€¦

Secretary Alexander Pierce

[img src=""http://admin.mashable.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/alexander.pierce.jpg"" caption=""Robert Redford (left) plays Secretary Alexander Pierce in ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier."""" credit="""" alt=""alexander.pierce""]

What happened: Robert Redford plays the U.S. Secretary of State -- whoâ€™s really a Hydra shill.

Why itâ€™s important: Because I thought for the whole movie that heâ€™s the Red Skull, and I still do. The last we saw Skull, he was being sucked into another plane by the power of the Tessaract; but he doesnâ€™t go down that easily. Heâ€™ll be back. Alexander Pierce was gunned down at the end of the film, and Iâ€™m shocked he didnâ€™t rip his face off to reveal that evil crimson deathâ€™s head. But hey, that could still happen.

That 'Sharon' they were talking about? Thatâ€™s Sharon Carter!

[img src=""http://admin.mashable.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/sharon.carter.jpg"" caption=""Emily VanCamp plays Sharon Carter in ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"""" credit="""" alt=""Emily VanCamp""]

What happened: Emily VanCamp turned out to be more than just Steve Rogersâ€™ comely nurse next-door-neighbor, thatâ€™s what â€“ she was a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent assigned to protect him. Later we find out her name is really â€œSharon.â€

Why itâ€™s important: Because Sharon Carter -- Agent 13 was her handle in the movie -- is Steve Rogersâ€™ No. 1 girlfriend in the comic books, and sheâ€™s awesome. Sheâ€™s later turned and unwittingly carries out the assassination of Cap. Could her presence signal a forthcoming movie that will follow the comic booksâ€™ â€œDeath of Captain Americaâ€ storyline?

Researchers at the University of Texas-Austin have developed an ultra-thin, temporary tattoo-like device that could store patients' medical information and release medicine directly into their skin -- a first for bio-integrated electronics.

[seealso slug=""tech-breakthroughs-2013""]

This breakthrough could revolutionize patient care. For example, it could one day be used to treat patients with diseases such as Parkinson's or epilepsy by tracking their movement , according to Nature(Opens in a new window).

It uses soft, flexible materials that house a 4-centimeter long, 2-centimeter wide, .3-millimeter thick device that contains sensors, RAM capabilities, microheaters and medicine. The patch sticks to skin through electrostatic force as any adhesives would disrupt electrical connectivity.

""This technology could help electronics that interact with humans be more mechanically compatible,"" Nanshu Lu, an assistant professor at UT-Austin who co-authored the study, said in a statement(Opens in a new window). ""In terms of application, its uses range from consumer products like rollable displays and solar cells, to personal digital health care like EKG and emotion sensors, to computer gaming.""

But doctors are still a long way off from putting the device to practical use. It only works if it's connected to a power source and data transmitter, and researchers need to find a way to make these compact and flexible as well, Lu told Nature. Plus, the data it collects would need to be converted into a readable format for doctors to make use of it.

7030245,8 Tips for Success on Facebook's New Video Advertising Platform,"Facebook has been changing the game for advertisers since its inception a decade ago. And with its new video advertising platform, there are now even more ways to reach your target audience. But how should you use the tool to generate the most successful results? To find out, I asked a panel of eight entrepreneurs from the Young Entrepreneur Council (YEC) what tricks they have for getting the most out of it (without alienating users). Their responses are below:

1. Stay Focused

Credit:

Be clear about what you are trying to accomplish and don't kid yourself about your time-limited ability to communicate and compel. Don't take a ""spray-and-pray"" approach and hope that you will convince people to take action by overwhelming them. Start with a short list of what you need to accomplish. Then cut it in half and then execute off of that painfully narrowed list. If you aren't upset about how short the list is, then you probably aren't focused enough.

- Seth Talbott(Opens in a new window), Preferling(Opens in a new window)

2. Watch Without Sound

Credit:

Facebook's new video advertising platform will automatically play videos in a user's news feed without sound, rather than having a user click or tap to play a video. If a user does click or tap the video, Facebook plays the video in fullscreen with sound. This feature is important to note. Talking head videos won't fly very well with Facebook users. To take full advantage of this new advertising tactic, make sure the video effectively achieves your advertising objective without sound.

- Brett Farmiloe(Opens in a new window), Internet Marketing Company(Opens in a new window)

3. Don't Reuse TV Ads

Credit:

Rather than reuse TV advertisements for Facebook's new video ad platform, make sure to take into account that Facebook is a different platform from traditional TV. Simply reusing content is a weak strategy for success. Be sure to research how Facebook's video ads are unique from traditional video content, including the autoplay aspect and sound differences. The more you learn about Facebook's rules for its video ad platform, the better equipped you will be to create unique video ads that perform really well on this specific network.

- Doreen Bloch(Opens in a new window), Poshly Inc.(Opens in a new window)

4. Share Something Great Fast

Credit:

Facebook's new video platform allows videos to play instantaneously for users that are scrolling their News Feeds. Create short videos that give your audience value. Know your audience. The first seven seconds need to grab their attention. Focus on the opening of the video. If it's bad, the user will continue to browse their News Feed and the end of your video won't matter.

- Joe Apfelbaum(Opens in a new window), Ajax Union(Opens in a new window)

5. Keep It Short

Credit:

When making your video, focus on one singular topic, and limit it to just a few minutes. If there's more you want to cover, shoot an additional video.

- Andrew Schrage(Opens in a new window), Money Crashers Personal Finance(Opens in a new window)

6. Promote Your Posts

Credit:

With Promoted Posts, you can get cheap traffic as low as a penny per click. We've done it! By creating posts on your fan page and setting up a Promoted Post, you can drive a large amount of visitors to your post to then drive traffic back to your website. If you're not using Facebook Advertising, get started now!

- Chris Brisson(Opens in a new window), Call Loop(Opens in a new window)

7. Specify Your Audience

Credit:

Facebook offers the opportunity to contextually advertise. Make sure that the audience is well curated for the business you are pitching and donâ€™t cast too wide a net.

- Alex Friedman(Opens in a new window), Ruckus (Opens in a new window)

8. Build a Social Following

Credit:

Advertising to Facebook users requires a different approach than other platforms. First, you must understand the mindset of the users. They are typically browsing Facebook to get information about their social life, friends and events. Advertisers will get better results by featuring videos that are entertaining and viral. You can get them to come to your page or website only after you've already engaged their interest. Your goal should be to build a social media following instead of trying to make a direct sale immediately after posting a video ad.",4/7/2014 0:00,0.546624,34,0,0,4.743284,10,Business,0,7337.914,3675.072,7200,0.427778,0.130556,0.029851,0.01791,0.4,-0.4,1600

An audacious vision... In my experience, it's hard to come by leaders who truly prioritize understanding the people they're building for. After talking to [Pinterest's founders, Ben Silbermann(Opens in a new window) and Evan Sharp(Opens in a new window)], I was all-in. Itâ€™s the audaciousness of the companyâ€™s mission that captured my imagination. Pinterest is a service that can illuminate the relationships between the worldâ€™s ideas, things and people -- we can help our Pinners enjoy moments of pure discovery: New places, new ideas, things to make, things to do and even intimate moments of self-discovery. I couldnâ€™t pass up the chance to be a part of a team that realizes that opportunity.

The transformative power of discovery... After studying the developmental importance of imaginary friends in graduate school, I worked at IDEO(Opens in a new window) and then most recently at Facebook. On my last project, I was the lead researcher on the Facebook Graph Search team, where I became obsessed with the transformative power of discovery experiences. Searching for information is great, but people love discovering personally meaningful things even more -- which is an experience that Pinterest delivers.

The ""research guy""... As the first researcher at Pinterest, it felt good to be the â€œresearch guyâ€ on the creative team; but what I really wanted was to bring together a team of researchers that cared most about making Pinterest better for Pinners. We now have a multidisciplinary team of five researchers who deliver end-to-end strategic insights. Being one part of an amazing team of career researchers feels so much better than being the lone â€œresearch guy.â€

Working for the underdog... I think what differentiates our culture now is that itâ€™s incredibly intentional. People at Pinterest have strong opinions and deliver amazing work. Even as we grow, weâ€™re a scrappy company where everyone is swiftly getting things done together. Everything is done for a reason and that makes a difference, and this sort of thoughtfulness is true of all teams -- from engineering to HR and all the rest. We still have a ways to go. Weâ€™re still an underdog, and I like that.

Today, Pinterest has 240 employees.

Maintaining the entrepreneurial spirit... When I joined Wayfair, the entrepreneurial spirit was extremely evident and contagious, just as it is today. We're never truly ""done"": Weâ€™ve expanded into Europe and Australia, rebranded from CSNStores to Wayfair and merged with iconic brands, such as DwellStudio(Opens in a new window). I try to capture that entrepreneurial spirit and project the feeling that I felt in my interview when I conduct interviews now.

Evolving responsibilities... My initial responsibilities involved adding products to our various microsites while simultaneously answering customer service calls from end-user consumers. I now manage two teams: an exclusive designer trade services team, which consists of business account managers focused on providing design professionals with custom product, pricing, content and logistic solutions for their clients; as well as a specialized sales team for high-profile consumers shopping our AllModern(Opens in a new window) and DwellStudio sites. I've enjoyed traveling in both the U.S. and internationally for AllModern, and currently host booths at trade shows across the county for interior designers, architects and contractors.

Still feels like a startup... The key to Wayfairâ€™s success is that externally, we are an established corporate company and a growing household name -- but in our employeesâ€™ eyes, we still feel like a startup where everyoneâ€™s ideas are valued and everyone at any level or tenure can have an immediate impact. I love the people I work with. Even after the longest or most challenging days, I always think, â€œI work with extremely talented people. I couldnâ€™t ask for better partners.â€

Today, Wayfair has 1,400 employees.

There aren't many businesses that put trust in you to take the reins and build without being impeded by bureaucracy. Integral gave me the chance to prove myself as a product manager in this industry.

Freedom and flexibility... My role has evolved pretty organically, as opposed to a linear path you see in larger companies. I am still a product manager, but I have gone from developing the video solution to also managing the API solution and working on a portion of the mobile offering at the company. Even as a growing company, Integral has fostered and encouraged the ability to work in cross-functional teamwork outside of my current product group. The company has pushed me to reach higher expectations while also giving me the freedom to work in an environment that is conducive to my strengths.

No ""seniority"" complexes... The pace at which Integral is growing is exciting, but what makes it great is that Integral has been able to stay true to its culture and environment. Even as we have grown, it is still the same open workplace, with high visibility into where the company is currently and where it is headed in the coming year(s). I always describe our company structure as ""flat."" Everyone treats each other with the same respect; there is no ""seniority"" complex here. It is really a place where you can embrace change and be a part of the innovation. Showing that you can easily roll with the punches is one way to ensure your success here.

A sense of pride... One of the biggest things that keeps me going is seeing my colleagues love what they do. I used to work at places where people just did it because ""it pays the bills."" At Integral, you get rewarded for your hard work by the company, but you also feel a sense of pride for your accomplishments.

Today, Integral Ad Science has 96 employees.

In the video above, Tara explains what it's like to be hire #74.

Getting paid to work out... The atmosphere at Clif is pretty awesome -- it's a fun place to work because we take our work seriously, but we don't take ourselves very seriously. One of the coolest things is that we get paid to work out. We have a gym on-site with personal trainers, who have such broad areas of expertise. I can go in and talk to Joe(Opens in a new window) about a running plan for a marathon, or I can talk to Sadie(Opens in a new window) about how to work on my kettlebell swing. And this all happens at work. It's part of our culture because of our athletic heritage.

The spirit of adventure... We're always evolving and changing, and with the wonderful people I get to work with every day, I always get to learn something new or try a new adventure -- whether it be some sort of wild activity like running 20 miles in the mountains or working on a nutritious and organic food recipe for a new product. We've become this group of athletes and foodies doing fun adventures together -- there's a 150-mile bike ride that Gary puts on, or we'll all go out camping or river rafting. Or even just a couple people from the office will come together to go for a run in the middle of the afternoon. It's just a really fun place to work.

Today, Clif Bar & Company has 350 employees.

No cubicles here... When I walked in for my first interview, I was taken aback. Everyone was working together side by side, surge protectors serving as the only real divider between people. It was so different from the large cubicles I was used to. After carefully examining the size of each personâ€™s table, I saw that I would still have enough space for a laptop, monitor, keyboard, mouse and writing area, so I thought, â€œOkay, I can make this work.â€ What excited me about BrightEdge, and continues to excite me today, is how everyone operates with such an intense sense of urgency and commitment toward innovating and building the best technology.

The ""go-to"" girl... My reputation at BrightEdge is the â€œhill-taker.â€ If there is a challenging, cross-functional, high impact project that needs tackling, Iâ€™m often the go-to person. Iâ€™ve had the great opportunity to program, manage and lead content development for our website relaunch, launch the BrightEdge Training & Certification program(Opens in a new window), lead messaging and the press announcement for our Series D financing and collaborate with our CEO on his keynote presentation for our industry event, Share(Opens in a new window).

Outgrowing offices left and right... BrightEdge is all about innovating ahead of the curve, and as a result, we outgrew all of our offices. We moved our headquarters to a beautiful, sleek new multi-level space in San Mateo, Calif., moved into great new offices in New York and London and recently opened a Chicago office. Since I joined the company two years ago, weâ€™ve had more than 20 major product releases. In that time, we have developed technology to address Googleâ€™s shift to 100% Secure Search with our Page Reporting(Opens in a new window) technology and released innovations around local and mobile SEO, to name a few. Our product has evolved from an SEO platform focused on sites, search and social, to advanced content marketing technology.

Relentless commitment... The culture is fast-paced, and people operate with an intense sense of urgency. Every single person has a relentless commitment to customer success, technological innovation, growth and continued market leadership. Teams are cross-functional, with people across all levels and departments working together to do whatever it takes to accomplish our goals and succeed. That sense of team is also fostered by our Friday lunches, which rotate each week and give each team the opportunity to present what they are working on. BrightEdge really exemplifies what Silicon Valley is all about: A meritocracy. One of our core values is 'People Success,' and that rings true. Twenty three people were promoted in Q1 alone. I really appreciate the opportunities Iâ€™ve been given to take on challenging projects and grow professionally.

Today, BrightEdge has 225 employees.

Launching a career... Being new to the New York City job market and really wanting to land a position in online marketing, I jumped at the opportunity to get started. Overall, I like the excitement and ownership that comes with being at a small company, but your boss or the management team make a huge difference on how the job will turn out. I definitely used the interview process to get as much of a feel for the managersâ€™ and ownersâ€™ personalities as they did for me. I also knew that structure and roles can be loose, so I wanted to make sure they had clear objectives.

The ""big break""... The thing that excited me most about Ajax Union was that it was my ""big break"" in the city. I had finally found a job in the industry I wanted to work in -- since it was a smaller company, they were open to taking on employees that might not have the exact resume or qualifications they were looking for on paper; they were planning on investing in their employees' training and skills to help them grow with the company.

The ""Yes Man""... Within three months [of joining the company], I had completed a few training certification courses and said ""yes"" to every project given to me, learning what I didn't know along the way. As a result, I was added to one of the agency teams as a contributor on every kind of project they had -- from social media to technical SEO, paid search and blogging. I decided early-on that my goal would be to advance as much as I could in order to gain as much experience as possible and put myself into a challenging and rewarding position. [With this mentality], in less than a year I found myself in the role of an agency manager and was in charge of my own client list and a small team of specialists.

A place of learning... The culture is fairly loose and entrepreneurial. We hold individuals to a high level of accountability and set high expectations to work toward specific goals. Since the company is a relatively new and small organization, it's a great environment for learning -- something that is promoted at every level of the organization so that we stay on top of industry trends.

Today, Ajax Union, LLC has 32 employees.

Dynamic and driven... The thing that excited me so much about joining Science was that I would be able to more directly influence the success and innovation of the companies and clients. The offices here are filled with dynamic and driven people, and the evolution of my role reflects it. There is now more cross-discipline collaboration and development of new search-marketing-style products. Additionally, I have taken a more active role in client pre-screening and strategy to make sure that we are focusing our efforts on partnerships with the highest potential.

High-growth impact... Obviously, since we are in a high-growth phase, there is considerable evolution across many parts of the business; but the most impactful to me is the emphasis we are placing on the direct delivery side of the business. We have successfully made a few key hires that have taken our delivery capabilities to a whole new level. This is easily the strongest cross-discipline online marketing team I have ever been a part of.

On morale and collaboration... [The culture is] driven, serious, intelligent and very innovative. Itâ€™s the result of putting a group of very smart and accomplished people in an office that doesnâ€™t promote the political game that is so damaging to morale and creativity. People freely collaborate and donâ€™t worry about taking credit for a success or assigning blame if things donâ€™t work out as planned. Our great morale here is a direct reflection of our management. They understand and promote this powerful and often overlooked aspect of office culture.

Today, Science, Inc. has 190 employees.

Cultivating culture from the ground up... What made me choose Homejoy was the chance to build the human resources practice from the ground up. Some people view HR as a traditional function; what people often don't understand is that HR can create a lot of human capital growth, as well as bring significant value-add to the business by leveraging people in the organization to reach their full potential. At Homejoy, it was clear I would have the opportunity to cultivate culture and partner with management to accommodate significant growth.

Rapid expansion... I was actually an early user of Homejoy and a big ambassador of the service. There are a lot of reasons why I get excited about Homejoy, but overall I know there is a tremendous opportunity to be really impactful. [Over the course of my employment], I've watched the rapid expansion across North America, our Series A and Series B announcements, as well as the launch of the Homejoy Foundation(Opens in a new window), an independent non-profit organization. Culture is constantly evolving with each new addition to the Homejoy team.

Everyone brings something to the table... Each employee brings a unique blend of personality, heart and talent; it's important to recognize and value each unique contribution. Everyone here matters; everything we do has meaning behind it and is important for Homejoy's trajectory. We believe everyone deserves a happy home, and our social mission is critical to us. And we're always hiring(Opens in a new window)!

Today, Homejoy has 115 employees.

No regrets... Naturally, it was a bit nerve-wracking to leave my job at Harvard to move to another state and join a startup that was a little over a year old -- but I knew it was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. I was so excited about the potential of the company and of being the first recruiter that the decision was a no-brainer. The only thing scarier than change is [monotony]; I knew Iâ€™d never regret it.

On teambuilding... My excitement about Birchbox was twofold. First, it was a chance to completely revolutionize the way consumers shop and the way brands interact with customers. Secondly, I would be the first person to work on recruiting -- I was being given the opportunity to build a team and, in turn, to play a major role in building the company. When I came on board full-time, I was a recruiting team of one with about 30 open jobs to fill. I was mainly focused on building an employment brand, building a recruitment process, training managers on that process and, of course, finding awesome people to fill those jobs. We now have a recruiting team of four people, and a 'people and culture' team of seven (and growing)!

Playing a role in success... One of the biggest, most impactful evolutions has been international expansion. Having colleagues around the world changes the way you perceive your customers and your daily work. Now, when I create a program, I have to think, ""Will this work with the European teams? How will we translate this? Will this scale as we grow?"" Another huge evolution has been our customer base -â€“ we now have over 800,000 subscribers, and 30% of our business is from ecommerce. This businessâ€™ success is more real than I ever could have imagined, and itâ€™s been an incredible experience to play a role in that success.

Infectious energy... Birchbox is extraordinarily collaborative. We have four leadership principles, one of which is â€œone team,"" and we live by that principle every day. There are so many moving pieces, and every day our employees partner with members of other teams. Our culture is also incredibly positive and optimistic; we are always looking for new challenges, and we set high goals for ourselves. That undying optimism, partnered with some very strong leadership and talented people, creates this infectious energy that drives you to want to do your absolute best work every day.

Today, Birchbox has 250 employees.

Couldn't stay away... My story is pretty unique; I was actually the third employee at Brand Networks as well as the 80th. I originally joined the company as the first full-time employee -- I did everything from maintaining client relationships, to project management, to managing the office and more. If it needed to get done, I did it. After a few years, I was offered another opportunity and left the company. Then, in October 2012, Jamie Tedford(Opens in a new window), the founder and CEO of Brand Networks, reached out to me looking to hire a director of marketing. Within two weeks, I was back at BN running marketing and PR.

The draw of a challenge... Between leaving Brand Networks and coming back, I was at Forrester Research(Opens in a new window) running social media marketing and at Rue La La(Opens in a new window), where I managed digital PR efforts, like blogger relations and social media content. I had a great experience at both places, and learned valuable strategies that have served me well. When the opportunity presented itself, I was excited to come back to Brand Networks and establish a marketing practice; what marketer wouldnâ€™t be motivated by that challenge? It was a lot to take on, but it has been an incredible experience.

Everyone on their ""A game""... Even though we are split up across eight different offices, weâ€™re still incredibly collaborative and supportive. I think it helps that we try to hire people that are kind, self-starting and hard-working; we call them â€œA-players."" I know everyone says this â€“- but it's the people here that keep me going. I work with some amazing people, and I love going to work with them every day. The challenge of keeping up with an ever-changing and ever-evolving industry also keeps me going.

Despite some issues with HBO Go crashing, the premiere proved to be wildly popular, attracting 6.6 million viewers during the 9 p.m. ET broadcast (making it HBO's most-watched telecast since the series finale of The Sopranos).

Spoilers to follow:

The episode followed the usual premiere rhythm as past seasons, catching up with old characters and introducing several new ones, namely Prince Oberyn Martell. The premiere also harkened back to the Red Wedding, with Sansa Stark and Jon Snow reeling after their losses.

And as usual, there were dragons, naked girls, bloody swords and a few quips every now and then to keep things in Westeros light and breezy.

7010335,Who's the 'Gayest Cartoon Character of All Time'? Roger That,"They say the Oscars are the ""gay Super Bowl,"" but the first gay Final Four belongs to Roger, the smart-aleck alien from American Dad.

Roger has been named â€œGayest Cartoon Character of All Timeâ€ in a bracket-style online-voting face-off by Logo TV, beating out a field of 32 that included Snagglepuss, Vanity Smurf and He-Man. (Wait, He-Man?)

""I'd like to thank everyone that voted for me. And I'd like to personally thank every MAN who voted for me ... Tonight. Within a 12-mile radius,"" Roger said in a statement provided by Logo TV.

The Viacom-owned pay-TV channel, which is focused on lifestyle programming aimed primarily at lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, announced the winner Monday night during a double episode of RuPaulâ€™s Drag Race.

Logo TV said the contest is an homage to the many ""gay"" TV characters who were -- despite being rather two-dimensional (get it?) -- pioneers.

Decades before gay characters became a staple on primetime or portrayed by real-life actors, they were highly visible on Saturday morning and on animated shows. Some are out and proud (think Big Gay Al from South Park or SNL's Ambiguously Gay Duo), some have always made you scratch your head wondering (like were Peppermint Patty and Marcie just friends?)

Just like the real March Madness, which also concluded Monday night, the â€œGayest Cartoonâ€ saw early upsets, with Squidward (Spongebob Squarepants) and He-Man (He-Man) being ousted in round one, Wayland Smithers (The Simpsons) and Bugs Bunny (Looney Toons) in round three, Betty Deville (Rugrats) and Xander (Drawn Together) in round three. Others who made surprisingly early exits: Scar (The Lion King), Peppermint Patty (Peanuts) and Snagglepuss.

People in skin-tight red, blue and yellow suits rolled around on inflatable balls, performed acrobatic routines and walked on stilts.

[seealso slug=""breaking-news-twitter""]

The performers certainly generated a crowd, but not solely for their acrobatic talents. Instead, this was another Google Bus protest, an increasingly common occurrence in San Francisco where citizens are expressing displeasure over rising rent costs and gentrification brought on by Silicon Valley's tech growth. The tech shuttles, which are referred to as ""Google Buses"" -- regardless of which company operates them -- serve as symbol for this anger.

But while last Tuesday's protest was a clever way to attract attention, multiple protests in the following days have taken a turn for the bizarre.

A group of protesters in Oakland, Calif. mounted a bus full of Yahoo employees last Wednesday, before one protester vomited on the vehicle's windshield.

On Saturday, protestors brought signs and banners to the house of Kevin Rose, a general partner and venture capitalist at Google Ventures. Claiming to be a group called ""The Counterforce(Opens in a new window),"" the protesters handed out fliers to Rose's neighbors that had the headline ""Kevin Rose: Parasite!"" The flier cited Rose as a reason that rents have skyrocketed:

As a partner venture capitalist at Google Ventures, Kevin directs the flow of capital from Google into the tech startup bubble that is destroying San Francisco. The start-ups that he funds bring the swarms of young entrepreneurs that have ravaged the landscapes of San Francisco and Oakland.

In both instances, protests were taken to a more extreme level than what San Francisco has previously seen with the bus blockades. However, the two incidents are not unprecedented: A Google Bus' window was smashed during an Oakland protest in December, and The Counterforce claimed another personal attack in Berkeley, Calif. when the group protested outside the home of Google engineer Anthony Levandowski in January, calling him ""evil.""

The Gbus minus window. pic.twitter.com/qfMnzFgiLf(Opens in a new window)â€” Craig Frost (@craigsfrost) December 20, 2013(Opens in a new window)

The increased intensity of these protests leads to other questions: Have protesters gone too far? Is targeting an individual's home or vandalizing private property crossing the line?

It's a tough question to answer, said Tom Temprano, co-president of Harvey Milk LGBT Democratic Club(Opens in a new window), one of the organizations that appealed San Francisco's proposed tech-shuttle program last week to the city's Board of Supervisors.

Temprano and his organization are working on the tech-shuttle issue from a political angle, putting pressure on politicians and city administrators to initiate change. That said, he doesn't believe he has the right to dictate how others get their message across.

""When you threaten to take away something as essential as the roof over someone's head, they're going to respond,"" Temprano said, adding that he hasn't participated in any of the blockade protests to date. ""For some folks, it's hitting home hard, and they're hitting back in a way that they feel is most appropriate.""

""I personally don't feel comfortable telling a protester whose grandmother has been forced to move the South Bay because she was evicted from her home of 30 years how they should or should not be responding to this crisis.""

To some of those who responded to the news on Twitter, calling out individuals at their home and vandalizing buses crosses the line of acceptability. Google Ventures did not respond to Mashable's request for comment, but it appears the protesters got at least one prize out of their trip to Rose's house: a Twitter declaration in support of their cause.

7010290,Watch HBO's 'Silicon Valley' Premiere on YouTube for Free,"HBO just posted the first 30-minute episode of its new show Silicon Valley onto the network's YouTube channel, a strategy HBO used for Girls earlier this year.

The comedy debuted Sunday night after Game of Thrones, but now people who missed the premiere or want to watch it again can view it for free on YouTube instead of logging through the company's online subscription service HBO Go.

[seealso slug=""hbo-silicon-valley-premiere-entourage/""]

The show follows introverted programmer Richard (Thomas Middleditch) and focuses on his compression algorithm hidden within his new music site. When his Google-like employer, Hooli, and a venture capitalist discover the algorithm, a bidding war emerges.

The episode opens with Kid Rock performing at an expensive yet stale startup party. Amid the money-makers on the guest list is Google chairman Eric Schmidt, just one of many cameos and references to actual tech behemoths throughout the eight-episode series.

The sitcom was somewhat inspired by co-creator Mike Judge (King of the Hill, Beavis and Butt-head and Office Space), who worked begrudgingly at a Silicon Valley startup in the 1980s.

Silicon Valley aims to satirically capture the startup scene. Apple co-founders Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak are mentioned in the show's first trailer as well.

Offering the episode on YouTube is one way HBO is courting its active online fan base.

""For us, this is an increasingly challenging demographic to reach with traditional means,"" Sabrina Caluori, HBO's vice-president of social media and marketing, told Mashable in January about HBO's YouTube strategy and overall online game plan.

7010147,6 Major Hollywood Movie Studios File Copyright Lawsuit Against Kim Dotcom,"The other legal shoe dropped on Monday when a group of movie studios filed a lawsuit against Kim Dotcom, the man behind the now defunct video upload site Megaupload.com.

This latest legal action follows the 2012 indictment by the U.S. Justice Department that targeted Megaupload.com, its creator, Dotcom, and his partners. That legal action claimed that the website brought in around $175 million in illegal proceeds.

[seealso slug=""kim-dotcom-political-party-megaparty""]

""Megaupload wasnâ€™t a cloud storage service at all, it was an unlawful hub for mass distribution,â€ said Steven Fabrizio, senior executive vice president and global general counsel of the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), in a statement on the organization's website on Monday.

The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, lists just about every major motion picture studio in Hollywood as plaintiffs, including Fox, Disney, Paramount, Universal, Columbia and Warner.

The legal complaint (PDF)(Opens in a new window) goes into a great detail explaining how, in the plaintiffs' view, Megaupload profited from illegally providing access to large amounts of copyrighted work.

""Only premium subscribers (estimated to be 1% of users) could use Megaupload for long-term file storage,"" reads the legal complaint. ""Thus, by design, Megaupload functioned not as a private online storage locker, but rather as a hub for uploading and downloading infringing copies of popular movies and television shows, including plaintiffs' copyrighted works.""

Further explaining how Megaupload worked to obscure what exactly was on the site, the legal complaint even outlines how the site handled its database.

""To conceal the scope of infringement occurring on the Megaupload website, defendants did not provide users with a searchable index of files available for download from the Megaupload website (although defendants themselves had access to such an index),"" reads the legal complaint. ""Instead, defendants relied on numerous third party 'linking' sites to host, organize, and promote URL links to Megaupload-hosted infringing content, including plaintiffs' copyrighted works.""

Later in the complaint, the studios even detail how they believe Megaupload encouraged piracy, while maintaining the appearance of discouraging it by offering an Abuse Tool to report copyright infringing files on the site.

""The Abuse Tool did not actually function in the manner defendants represented,"" reads the legal complaint. ""If the infringing file on defendants' servers had more than one URL link associated with it, which was often the case, then in response to a URL link reported by a copyright holder through the Abuse Tool, defendants would delete only that particular URL link itself, and would leave the other links and the infringing file in place on Megaupload's system â€¦""

Meanwhile, Dotcom took to Twitter to react to the new charges. ""Just like the DOJ criminal case against #Megaupload the @MPAA case is a load of nonsense and won't succeed after scrutiny of the facts,"" wrote Dotcom.

Just like the DOJ criminal case against #Megaupload(Opens in a new window) the @MPAA(Opens in a new window) case is a load of nonsense and won't succeed after scrutiny of the facts.â€” Kim Dotcom (@KimDotcom) April 7, 2014(Opens in a new window)

""We believe that the motion picture studios' claims lack merit and we intend on vigorously defending the action,"" Ira Rothken, Kim Dotcom's legal representative, told Mashable. ""We think this is a desperate attempt to try to provide cover for the meritless criminal case brought by the Department of Justice.""

Regarding the various technical claims made against Megaupload in the new legal complaint, Rothken remains convinced that neither the site, nor Dotcom and his associates did anything wrong. ""We believe [these claims] show a lack of technical sophistication by the movie studios,"" says Rothken.

Further, Rothken indicated that the timing of the civil complaint from the studios is curious, and suggested that it might be designed to bolster the Justice Department's July extradition case(Opens in a new window) against Dotcom by waging a ""war of attrition"" to negatively ""impact [Dotcom's] resources.""

However, when Mashable contacted the MPAA, a spokesperson said that the timing of the action was first and foremost related to the three-year statute of limitations(Opens in a new window) on copyright cases.

The MPAA representative also told Mashable that new information (PDF)(Opens in a new window), released by the Justice Department in December, was also helpful in pushing the civil case forward. According to the spokesperson, that information includes ""detailed analysis of what was happening on Megaupload.""

Nevertheless, based on the result of a previous civil suit(Opens in a new window) against Megaupload in 2012, Rothken believes this new legal action will be stayed by the courts.

OK, quit your bellyaching.

How I Met Your Mother co-creator Carter Bays announced on Twitter Friday that the show will release an alternate ending to the controversial series finale. Bays called the new ending ""very different.""

The alternate ending will be featured on the series DVD box set, available this fall.

Following the series finale, in which ""the mother"" passes away, leaving Ted Mosby widowed and pining for former flame Robin, fans were outraged, claiming they were duped and the ending was unfair. Before announcing the news of the alternate ending, Bays tweeted that the producers stood by the first version of the finale, but still ""loved"" the other version they edited out.

[nggallery id=""15819"" layout=""list"" title=""top""]

Will the alternate ending show the mother alive and well? Will Robin and Barney never get a divorce? Will we finally learn about the pineapple?

For those who simply miss a How I Met Your Mother-type sitcom in their Monday night TV lineups, the show's spinoff, How I Met Your Dad, is already in the works.

Bays tweeted that work had already started on the editing process for the spinoff. Hopefully, Bays won't need to release an alternate ending for that show, too.

Also, we're editing How I Met Your Dad right now and I think it's great. Greta Gerwig is about as delightful as it gets.â€” Carter Bays (@CarterBays) April 4, 2014(Opens in a new window)

The Taiwan-based company's unaudited results(Opens in a new window), released on Monday, showed a net loss before taxes of $62 million on revenues of $1.1 billion, down from $1.4 billion(Opens in a new window) in the previous quarter. The loss comes after HTC posted its first quarterly loss ever last October. HTC posted a net profit of $10 million(Opens in a new window) in its fourth quarter, which came in below analysts' expectations.

Released in March 2013, the One was released on a staggered basis due to manufacturing delays. Upon release, many reviewers deemed it the best Android phone(Opens in a new window) on the market. Like the One's predecessor, the One X, the positive reception didn't make up for a lack of marketing support.

HTC put a lot of money behind the One launch, but even some insiders at the company(Opens in a new window) questioned its marketing campaign, which featured A-lister Robert Downey Jr. riffing on possible meanings behind the HTC acronym (which included ""hipster troll carwash"").

7010160,"Kentucky vs. UConn: Brackets Be Damned, It's the Final We Deserve","Follow @MashableLive(Opens in a new window) on Twitter for our live coverage during Monday night's game.

Go ahead and grab your sharpest knife. Because no matter how you slice this thing, Monday night's NCAA title game between Kentucky and Connecticut is the perfect March Madness finale.

In one corner: Kentucky's precocious teenage prodigies; the relentlessly hyped Greatest Recruiting Class of All-Time; the kids who were given everything before they earned anything; the NBA-obsessed villains the media loved to tear down amid mid-season hiccups; the slick salesman on the sideline who bucks everything college sports purports to stand for -- but, in some ways, might be the most honest(Opens in a new window) coach around.

In the other corner: UConn's lovable underdog Huskies; the team no one expected to be here; the Cinderella whose luck just won't run out; the waterbug guards whose quick feet wreak defensive havoc; the burgeoning legend of Shabazz Napier; the second-year coach returning the program he once played for to glory through toughness and teamwork.

[seealso url = ""http://mashable.com/2013/11/25/kiwi-gardner-basketball-youtube""]

Monday night's championship game, set to tip off at 9:10 p.m. ET on CBS, brings the ultimate marriage of exciting styles, contrasting narratives and talented prospects (Kentucky alone trots out eight -- eight! -- probable NBA players). There's also an added bonus for fans -- you can stream the entire game for free online.

Kentucky: Right back to where they started from

Even the numbers prove Monday's matchup is special. Pairing eight-seed Kentucky against seven-seed UConn, this year's contest boasts the highest combined seeding of any championship game ever.

7+8=15 is the highest total seeding in a championship game, but the second-highest wasnâ€™t too long ago â€” (3)UConn vs. (8)Butler in 2011.â€” Jonathan Ellis (@jonathanellis) April 6, 2014(Opens in a new window)

But let's call a timeout to regroup and debunk. Kentucky, seeded eighth to start the tournament, is technically the bigger surprise here. Don't believe that for a second, however (Las Vegas odds-makers sure don't, making Kentucky early Monday-night favorites by 2.5 points). These Wildcats are right where most predicted they'd end up way back when the college hoops season started last November.

Kentucky coach John Calipari convinced the high school class of 2013(Opens in a new window)'s second, fifth, seventh, ninth, eleventh and nineteenth-ranked recruits to join him in Lexington this season. Many saw that as, essentially, the most Coach Cal thing ever. Some people love the man, some people hate the man, some love to hate him and some hate the fact that they love him.

But no matter where you fall on the Coach Cal feelings spectrum, this year's freshman class probably made you double down on those emotions. Could he win the title with another batch of one-year rentals? What rule-bending(Opens in a new window) might come to light later?

That's why, when these Wildcats struggled more than anyone thought they would through the regular season, so many reveled in the growing pains. But even in their brief stint as underachievers, the Wildcats were always glamorous.

Put it this way: the rapper Drake is a man who's thrown his fandom behind such favorites as Johnny Manziel and the Miami Heat. Saturday, after Kentucky beat Wisconsin in the Final Four, there he was in the Wildcats' locker room.

SBNation's Twitter account summed the scene up aptly:

STARTED AT THE TOP, SUCKED A LITTLE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE YEAR, NOW WEâ€™RE HERE pic.twitter.com/6SEzAt78OL(Opens in a new window)â€” SB Nation (@SBNation) April 6, 2014(Opens in a new window)

UConn: The Kevin and Shabazz Show

Contrast that with UConn. They, too, have players who make scouts drool -- DeAndre Daniels is capable of going toe to toe, talent-wise, with almost anyone Kentucky can offer. But these aren't the Wildcats' blue-chip recruits; these aren't the kids the online basketball world started hearing about years before they even took the SAT.

The Huskies are a team molded in their coach's image. Forty-one-year-old Kevin Ollie played for legendary UConn coach Jim Calhoun in the early '90s. He never averaged more than eight points per game in the NBA, but nonetheless scratched out a 13-year career. His contributions may not have shown up in the box score, but he was always a guy you wanted to have around.

When Calhoun stepped down before last season, Ollie took over. He guided the program through a rough stretch -- academic violations from the Calhoun years meant they couldn't play in last year's March Madness -- then led the Huskies to the Final Four in the first year he was allowed to do so.

Like Ollie, these Huskies -- talented as they are -- rely more on grit, teamwork and clutch plays than they do sheer genetic brilliance. Upset after upset over the past two weeks have been built on this formula (and even helped one Huskies fan win $390,000 in Las Vegas).

But any discussion of UConn's magical run has to start and end with one person: Shabazz Napier. Napier was a headstrong freshman when Kemba Walker led the Huskies to a national title with a legendary performance back in 2011. Now Napier's doing his best Kemba impression; he's been The Guy for this team since he hit a game-winning buzzer beater to take down Florida back in December. Lately, he's only increased the heroics.

Napier is small, quick, fearless and can score points in bushels. In short: He's a treat to watch play college basketball. Here's a highlight reel one fan put together last week:

On the biggest stage of all

The teams, the coaches, the storylines -- Monday night's game will even be played in the perfect venue for today's college sports zeitgeist.

North Texas' AT&T stadium is typically home to the NFL's Dallas Cowboys, but it's hosting the Final Four this year. More than 79,000(Opens in a new window) fans packed the indoor stadium for Saturday's semifinals to watch amateur athletes in action. Before Saturday, so many humans had never watched a college basketball game together in one place before.

With lawsuits, unionization pushes and outspoken players attacking the NCAA's outdated amateurism model from all sides, many wonder how long the current college sports setup can last. Broadcast and marketing deals continue to bloat the revenues generated by college sports, and now the players finally want a piece of the pie.

This weekend won't change anything -- but could it be more appropriate that this year's Final Four is being held in an arena that holds five times the population(Opens in a new window) of Storrs, Conn., where UConn's campus is located?

And could the outsized nature of modern college sports be summed up any better than this image of a stadium video monitor grossly out-sizing the actual court of play?

Session attendance is shown on the stadium video monitor during the second half of an NCAA Final Four tournament college basketball semifinal game between Wisconsin and Kentucky Saturday, April 5, 2014, in Arlington, Texas. Credit: Tony Gutierrez

Social commentary aside, however, they don't call March Madness the Big Dance for nothing. And on the biggest stage, don't be surprised to find the NCAA tourney's biggest talents make themselves right at home -- no matter how young they are, or how late they've arrived to their own party.

The eccentric artiste climbs to the VIP balcony near her mother and rattles off the hit song's heightened bridge in New York City.

From her view on March 30, the 28-year-old pop star sees a sea of smartphones capturing her every move and melody. She hears her faithful ""Little Monsters"" sing along inside Roseland Ballroom, a storied venue that shuts down permanently after Gaga's seven-night residency ends April 7 with a finale performance.

Roseland can squeeze only 3,500 people under its historic roof, so Gaga collaborated with Verizon Wireless to live stream the final show Monday on GetMoreGaga.com(Opens in a new window) at 9 p.m. ET.

[seealso slug=""mia-janelle-monae-holograms/""]

The performance will conclude Roseland's nearly 58-year run at 239 West 52nd St. The venue, a former skating rink, opened in 1956 after its original 51st Street location, which operated since 1919, closed the same day the new building opened.

Gaga's skimpy outfits, rather tame by her standards, and her occasional profanity-laced dialogue during some parts of this night's show contrast with the behavior of Roseland's initial lineup of dance hall events and jazz performers.

""It's so f*cking hot,"" she blurted while removing her jacket. ""My t*ts can breathe now.""

Even in Roseland's current spot, ""The Twist"" was banned early on when reserved dancing was the norm and calm music fare was the offering in the 1950s into the 70s.

The venue eventually opened its doors to rowdier rock and pop musicians, with Madonna, Bob Dylan, Beyonce, Metallica, Radiohead, Fiona Apple and The Rolling Stones gracing the stage over the past three-and-half decades.

In 2013, Roseland saw some shows live streamed, including two that Mashable attended: Nicki Minaj's tweet-infused concert and Vampire Weekend's Twitter-influenced show.

The venue's evolution from an intimate setting to one where its events are experienced thousands of miles away via smartphones and computers is a sign of the times. Roseland's low-occupancy limit appears to have financially taken its toll amid competition from larger and newer venues around the city.

Though Roseland shutters forever after Gaga's Monday night gig, the memories -- both good and bad (a fatal shooting in 1984 and arrests related to a stabbing in 1990) -- remain for the countless people who have frequented the midtown Manhattan location.

""We've grown up together haven't we?,"" Gaga asked her Little Monsters at Roseland. ""But you're still wasted and you're still having fun.""

Like her fans, Roseland's occupants grew up a bit inside its walls, but now it's time for the fun to move to another venue as this NYC staple dims its lights with a fading flicker of songs from Lady Gaga's The Fame, Born This Way and Artpop.

When Gaga delivers the final note, the stage will be covered in rose petals.

6786449,Scientists: Search Crews Unlikely to Confuse Black Box 'Pings' With Whale Sounds,"The electronic â€œpingsâ€ heard by multiple ships that are hunting for missing Malaysian Airlines flight 370, which disappeared on March 8, have been described as the â€œbest lead yetâ€ in the complicated investigation.

However, officials have cautioned that the pings, which can be picked up by highly sensitive marine listening devices known as hydrophones -- and more advanced tools called â€œpinger locatorsâ€ -- may not in fact be from the aircraftâ€™s flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder. Instead, they could be from whales or other marine life, officials have said.

â€œFalse alerts may be experienced from biological sources such as whales or interference from shipping noise,â€ the Australian Joint Agency Coordination Center said on April 3.

But how easy is it for search crews to confuse the manmade ping from acoustic beacons attached to the plane's ""black boxes"" with the noises of a harmless dolphin or whale?

Scientists who study marine mammals and their underwater noises told Mashable that it is â€œdifficult to imagineâ€ that Navy analysts, who have been trained to recognize marine sounds, would confuse the pinger sounds with biological sounds. Scientists pointed to the fact that there are major differences between the frequencies at which living species generate noises, as well as the duration and temporal pattern of their sound pulses, compared to those of the acoustic beacons attached to the black boxes.

Referring to the sound frequency, duration and pattern, Catherine Berchok, a marine acoustics specialist at the federal National Marine Mammal Laboratory(Opens in a new window) in Seattle said she would â€œassume the aviation black box has a very unique combination of those three things.â€ At the same time, she says, â€œEach marine mammal has a particular way it uses these frequencies.â€

Berchok told Mashable that marine mammals can vocalize from very low to very high frequencies, whereas black box pings are designed to be emitted at a nearly constant frequency of 37.5 kHz. Such pings arenâ€™t audible to the human ear, which can only detect signals from 20 hz to 20 kHz, but the pings can be picked up by hydrophones.

By comparison, blue whales, Berchok said in an interview, emit a low frequency sound of about 10 hz, whereas dolphins can vocalize at up to 160 kHz. While some marine mammalsâ€™ do emit sounds within the frequency range of the flight recorders, they do so with far different patterns than the black box recorders do, Berchok says.

Steven Brecken, a spokesman for Honeywell, which manufacture both of the recorders(Opens in a new window) that were aboard Flight 370, said that a water-sensitive acoustic beacon attached to each recorder was designed to emit a signal at a rate of one pulse per second. He described the beacons as being about four inches wide and resembling â€œa roll of silver dollarsâ€ bolted to the recorders.

While the hydrophones listening for the pinging of the black boxes would likely be sensitive enough to detect marine mammal noises, scientists said the data would quickly reveal whether such sounds are actually coming from a black box.

For example, blue whales tend to emit their sounds at about 20 seconds at a time, repeating this pattern many times over.

â€œSignals in the 37.5 kHz range would most likely be echolocation, and it would be unlikely that an echolocating animal would make just two signals,â€ Berchok says of whales that use bursts of sound waves to determine their location and find predators and prey.

Dolphins and other toothed whales emit a rapid series of clicking sounds when they echolocate, which allows them to â€œseeâ€ underwater using sound waves, much like a submarine uses sonar to navigate the complex geography of the deep oceans. According to Manuel Castellote, a scientist at the Marine Mammal Lab, dolphin echolocation involves the emission of a broadband signal at ultrasonic frequencies greater than 20 kHz, sometimes going as high as 140 to 160 kHz.

A ping from the cockpit voice and flight data recorders would not have a signal that departs much from 37.5kHz, whereas an echolocation click tends to have a much wider range of frequencies within it, Castellote says.

â€œThese would be very easy to distinguish from a signal at 37.5 kHz by just looking at which frequencies have most of the acoustic energy,â€ he said in an email conversation.

Dolphin clicks and clicks from other toothed whales, such as sperm whales, donâ€™t last long when they are echolocating, with each click lasting about 100 microseconds. Such short duration sounds help the mammals hear echoes back with greater accuracy, allowing them to orient themselves in the water and find and hunt prey, he says.

â€œEcholocation signals in all toothed whales is generated in sequences of multiple clicks, and the time interval between these clicks is highly variable,"" Castellote said. ""A sequence of pings at 37.5 kHz with a constant interval of one second would be extremely easy to distinguish from echolocation by just looking at the temporal distribution of the ping,â€ Castellote said.

Brecken, of Honeywell, said it is not known whether the acoustic beacons would change their frequency characteristics as their batteries run out after end of the federally-mandated 30-day period. As of Monday, the plane has been missing for 31 days, which means the batteries could run out at any time now.

Berchock, of the Marine Mammal Lab, speculated that a weakened signal could make it more difficult for search workers to distinguish between the manmade and natural sources if the low battery levels changed the strength of the pings, their number, or the time between them.",4/7/2014 0:00,0.592105,5,0,2,4.48927,6,Entertainment,0,6019.393,3627.818,3000,0.440909,0.167424,0.042918,0.021459,0.066667,0,1300
7030038,Flight 370: Searchers Detect Signals as Black Box Batteries Near Their End,"An Australian navy ship in the Indian Ocean has detected signals that are consistent with those from an airplane's black box. Authorities say it is their ""most promising"" lead so far in the search for the missing Malaysia Airlines flight 370.

The ship is towing a device called a pinger locator, which detected two signals on Monday. The first lasted two hours and 20 minutes, and the second lasted for 13 minutes. On the latter, two distinct signals were audible, which would be consistent with a flight data recorder and a cockpit voice recorder, said Malaysia's Minister of Defense Hishammuddin Hussein.

""We've got a visual indication on a screen, and we've also got an audible signal. And the audible signal sounds to me just like an emergency locator beacon,"" said retired Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston, according to CNN(Opens in a new window).

This discovery comes just one day after a Chinese ship detected a pulse signal with a frequency of 37.5 kHz -- the same frequency that black boxes use.

The signals detected by both ships are located about 1,100 miles from Perth -- far enough away from land to assure authorities that the signals are from a man-made device -- in an area of the ocean that is about 14,800 feet deep.

However, officials say it could take days before they can confirm if the signals are from flight 370. After a month of false leads, authorities are still skeptical. Though they say this particular clue is promising, it's still unconfirmed that it's from the missing Boeing 777 that was carrying 239 people.

""Authorities must be cautious about unconfirmed findings and making conclusions,"" Hussein said at a news conference Monday. ""We are cautiously hopeful that there will be a positive development in the next few days, if not hours.""

Researchers out of the University of Michigan have developed an infrared sensor that could eventually be used in the production of night vision contact lenses.

[seealso slug=""google-smart-contact-lens""]

Infrared imaging typically involves multiple technologies to view all ranges of the infrared spectrum, in addition to bulky cooling equipment. It is most often used by doctors to monitor blood pressure, identifying chemicals or simply seeing in the dark. Thanks to graphene, a tightly-packed layer of carbon atoms, scientists were able to create a more accessible sensor that only needs to be at room temperature to work properly.

""We can make the entire design super thin,"" Zhaohui Zhong, an assistant professor at the university, said in a statement(Opens in a new window). ""It can be stacked on a contact lens or integrated with a cell phone.""

Scientists detected light by watching how electrical charges in the graphene impacted a nearby current. They placed an insulating barrier between two graphene sheets and watched as electrons, set free when light touched the top layer, made their way to the bottom one. When the researchers measured a change in current from the top to the bottom layer, they were able to determine the brightness of the light that reached the graphene.

""Our work pioneered a new way to detect light,"" Zhong said. ""We envision that people will be able to adopt this same mechanism in other material and device platforms.""

This new sensor, which is smaller than a pinky nail, could have many benefits in the scientific and military communities (in addition to its more consumer-based possibilities). Google announced its development of a smart contact lens that could monitor glucose in January, and in February 2013, Nokia was granted $1.35 billion from the European Union to develop graphene as the strongest material in the world.

Nicolelis is training nine Brazilian paraplegic people, from ages 20 to 40, to use the exoskeleton. Three will attend the opening ceremony, and one will demonstrate how he or she can walk on the field.

The walking suit is connected to a head cap built with electrodes to pick up the user's brain waves. The electrode cap and walking suit translates the brain's signals into physical movements.

The A7s' 12.2 megapixel Exmor CMOS sensor is paired with Sony's BIONZ X image processor, giving the camera an enormous sensitivity range of ISO 50 â€“ 409600, meaning the camera can shoot 4K video in almost complete darkness.

The feature has its limitations: you can only store 1080p video internally; for 4K video, you'll need to pair the A7s with an external recorder.

Sony also points out that the Alpha 7s is the world's first camera that utilizes the entire width of a full-frame sensor for 4K recording, giving videographers all the features provided by the camera's sensor.

Full HD (1920x1080) video can be recorded at a 60p frame rate; for the ultra-high, 120fps shooting mode, you'll have to lower the resolution to 1280x720.

As far as codecs are concerned, in addition to AVCHD and MP4, Sony has adopted the XAVC S format, which allows for full HD recording at a 50 mbps data rate with lower compression.

So when a student's phone rang on April 1, she answered the call, only to have her (fake) pregnancy test results announced to her classmates. Barrows' reaction is priceless -- before (and after) finding out it was just a prank.

""We wanted to prank him because we have a great relationship with him and we knew he would enjoy a good joke,"" Josh Weiland, one of the students who orchestrated the prank, tells Mashable. ""His classroom environment is very open and relaxed, which makes students comfortable to ask questions.""

Weiland adds that Barrows' cellphone policy had never actually been enforced previously; this was the first time a student's phone rang in class.

Don't feel too bad for Barrows, though. It turns out the prank was just karmic retribution. Before the students pulled the pregnancy prank, Barrows attempted to fool his class by announcing a pop quiz.

""I think ours was a little better,"" Weiland joked.

The study, which was conducted by Russell Clayton, a doctoral student at the University of Missouri School of Journalism, found a positive correlation between Twitter use and relationship woes.

7009903,USAID Issues Vehement Denial of Reports About 'Cuban Twitter',"Last week, a scathing AP report accused the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) of running a ""covert"" project to build a Twitter-like social network in Cuba to stir political unrest in the island. On Monday, USAID denied some of the Associated Press' main claims in an unusually harsh denial that lists claims(Opens in a new window) ""followed by the facts.""

""The article contained significant inaccuracies and false conclusions about ZunZuneo,"" wrote USAID spokesperson Matt Herrick, using the Twitter-like service's Cuban name. ""It makes for an interesting read, but itâ€™s not true.""

ZunZuneo was a social network marketed to Cubans that was like a stripped-down version of Twitter. The network allowed subscribers to send and receive free updates via text message since USAID covered all the expenses. The AP reported that its operators, once the service reached ""critical mass"" intended to send political content to the subscribers, in the hopes of inspiring ""smart mobs"" and an eventual ""Cuban Spring."" The service, started in 2010, was retired two years later, due to lack of funds.

Herrick denied that the program was illegal or ""covert."" The spokesperson implied that it was ""discreet"" to minimize risks and ensure the safety of the USAID staff since sometimes the agency works in places where it's ""not always welcome.""

And even though it was low-profile, ZunZuneo wasn't kept secret from Congress, Herrick added, echoing almost word for word what the White House said(Opens in a new window) in response to the story. On Friday, President Obama's press secretary Jay Carney said USAID had to be ""discreet"" and added that the program ""had been debated in Congress and reviewed by the GAO [Government Accountability Office].""

In fact, the GAO had access to a plethora of documents about USAID's broader Cuba program, whose goal was to ""break the 'information blockade'"" and ""promote 'information sharing'"" in the country, also using ""new technologies"" or ""new media,"" Herrick wrote.

In another item on the list, Herrick denied that USAID kept the U.S. government's role in the project secret. The AP reported(Opens in a new window) that Mobile Accord, the company tapped to build the social network, wrote in an internal memo that it was ""crucial"" not to mention the U.S. government when discussing the project.

But Herrick said a USAID staff member was present during interviews to select people to lead the ZunZuneo project, and that the member's affiliation was always disclosed.

Herrick also denied a list of other facts reported by the AP: ZunZuneo didn't reach 40,000 users, he said, it reached 68,000. And to deny claims that USAID tried to hide that the money to fund the project came from the U.S., he said the funds were never earmarked for Pakistan and there was no shell company in Spain, as the Associated Press claimed.

""We welcome tough journalism -- and we embrace it,"" Herrick concluded. ""It makes our programs better. But we also believe itâ€™s important that the good work of USAID not be falsely characterized.""

The post makes for an unusually detailed denial from a U.S. government agency, but some basic facts remain: USAID sent $1.6 millions to Cuba's government-controlled telecom company for a social network experiment that, at the end of the day, was a failed attempt at breaking the ""information blockade.""",4/7/2014 0:00,0.577586,11,2,1,4.968661,10,Tech,0,3621.032,2244.615,3000,0.324167,0.136818,0.019943,0.005698,0,0,3000

7009860,What Microsoft's Takeover of Your Car Will Look Like,"Microsoft gave developers a close up and personal look at its plans for Windows at last week's Build conference.

Buried amid all the excitement around Cortana and other developments was a sneak peek at the company's in-car operating system concept.

[seealso slug=""microsoft-build-2014-preview""]

Presented by Steve Teixeira of Microsoft's developer division, the system bears a striking resemblance to Apple's recently unveiled CarPlay system. The four-minute presentation (watch above) showed off what Teixeira described as a projection of your phone's screen onto your dashboard display.

Included in the Windows in-car system menu are options to access maps, make telephone calls, send text messages, listen to music and view your automobile's diagnostic information. There's also a dedicated menu that allows you to view all your apps on one screen.

Another screen showed a panel that allows the driver to see how many miles he has driven, how many miles are left until service is due, the current weather and shareable data detailing the overall driving efficiency of your last trip. Teixeira also walked through live demos showing how the system can make a phone call and how the system handles maps.

According to Teixeira, part of the development of the system included a full wraparound driving simulator with eye tracking, allowing the testers to detect where drivers are looking while they're driving in the simulator.

Safety while using the in-car system seems to be an point of emphasis for Microsoft. For example, Teixeira indicated that the developer tools for the system will be geared toward allowing developers to build apps that conform with safe driving standards.

Details regarding the commercial name for the system or a release date were not revealed. Nevertheless, the demonstration was robust enough to prove that Microsoft's mobile efforts -- like Apple, Ford, Android and others -â€“ are targeting the car as the next frontier for mobile development.",4/7/2014 0:00,0.565217,8,1,0,4.996441,8,00000,1550,4747.362,2866.35,8560,0.257639,-0.07639,0.003559,0.017794,0.2,-0.3,1200

7008283,"Netflix, Hulu and ... Yahoo? Why Marissa Mayer Wants Original TV Programming","Marissa Mayer may soon take a break from acquiring companies and instead acquire some TV shows.

Yahoo is ""close"" to ordering four high-quality online TV series with budgets of as much as a ""few million dollars"" per episode, according to a recent report(Opens in a new window) in the Wall Street Journal. This would effectively put Yahoo in competition with a different group of Internet companies, including Netflix, Hulu and Amazon.

The Internet giant has offered original programming in the past, though for the most part it has come in the form of shorter web series. The decision to invest more on TV caliber programming is likely part of the company's larger goal to double down on quality online video. Yahoo announced an exclusive deal for the entire video catalogue of Saturday Night Live around this time last year and followed that up a few months later with the hiring of news anchor Katie Couric.

""While our video offering is still nascent, we have made some good progress in 2013,"" Mayer, Yahoo's CEO, told investors in an earnings call in January. ""With our continued commitment to expanding our video offering, we believe we are well positioned to grow video revenue in 2014.""

Yahoo appears to be considering a few different approaches to boost its video offerings: buying up original programming, trying to attract popular personalities(Opens in a new window) from YouTube and acquiring a significant online video service. Yahoo was first rumored to be looking to buy Dailymotion; now it's reportedly looking to buy(Opens in a new window) News Distribution Network (NDN).

Yahoo declined to comment for this story.

Brian Wieser, an analyst with Pivotal Research Group(Opens in a new window), argues that this could serve as an effective two-pronged approach to attract advertisers. By purchasing a video service like NDN, he says the company would improve its perception among advertisers in the short-term by increasing its video inventory, which ""would allow it to tell a story about how great it is in video."" High-quality original content, on the other hand, might lead to more ""durable"" revenue growth in the long-term. But the latter comes with some significant risk.

""You can produce a good long-term business, but you should have a fully baked out strategy. Otherwise there will be a lot of money lost making something that most people would deem successful,"" Wieser says. ""If you are spending a couple million dollars on a half-hour episode, you can't afford to have misses. You need to have hits.""

That is, of course, easier said than done. Even Hulu, Amazon and Netflix have had their share of flops when it comes to original programming. ""Until I'm persuaded otherwise, I suspect that what [Yahoo] thinks will make them stand out from the pack is old media celebrity names,"" says Andrew Tyndall, a media analyst.

Credit: comScore

Yahoo's video audience in the U.S. increased by 14% year-over-year, according to data from comScore, though it remains well behind competitors like Google, Facebook and AOL -- the last of which already offers original series. Yahoo may not be able to overtake Google or AOL in scale, but it could overtake them in quality, which would help drive up its ad revenue.

""Scale is important, but the quality can potentially be a differentiator,"" says Andrew Lipsman, VP of industry analysis at comScore.

That might sound obvious, but it would represent a notable change in strategy for Yahoo, whose strength was often seen as one of reach thanks to its massive user base -- 800 million worldwide, as of late last year.",4/7/2014 0:00,0.598361,6,1,1,4.748,6,Tech,0,4715.2,2943.471,2200,0.492252,0.084229,0.04,0.02,0,0,16900

YouTube lawyer GÃ¶nenÃ§ GÃ¼rkaynak also filed a lawsuit in the Administrative 4th Court of Ankara, the nation's capital, according to the Hurriyet Daily News(Opens in a new window). The lawsuit demands that the government cancel its ban.

The Turkish government blocked access to YouTube on March 27 after an anonymous user uploaded 15 videos of leaked government meetings that discussed military options in Syria. A local Ankara court reversed the ban for several hours on April 4, only to reinstate it after a speedy appeal by the Ankara GÃ¶lbaÅŸÄ± Public Prosecutor's Office.

The government reportedly may lift its ban if Google, which owns YouTube, agrees to remove the leaked material rom the site. However, this doesn't seem likely; the company has already refused to take down videos that allegedly indicate corruption among government officials.

The government also blocked Twitter last month, resulting in a slew of outrage on the social network as users found ways to circumvent the block. The block was lifted on April 2 after the Constitutional Court ordered the government to let users back on.

Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip ErdoÄŸan blasted the ruling to reinstate Twitter, and the nation's justice minister claimed the Constitutional Court had no authority to unblock the website after he initially came out in favor of the decision.

7029556,Job Seekers: Avoid These Background Check Horror Stories,"For many jobs on the market today, a background check is par for the course during the application and hiring process. In fact, around 87% of organizations report(Opens in a new window) that they conduct background checks on at least some applicants. Considering one in four American adults(Opens in a new window) has an arrest or conviction likely to show up on a background check, you can never be too cautious about looking into what an employer might find.

So what are employers discovering about your background -- and is it even true?

Background checks have made it into the news cycle recently, in part because of an EEOC filing(Opens in a new window) against BMW and Dollar General(Opens in a new window) for their extensive use of criminal background checks -- some of the crimes that the organizations used to weed out candidates happened more than 20 years ago.

While a little controversy isn't going to get rid of traditional background checks altogether, more people have become aware of the potential consequences of a check gone wrong. Background checks are far from perfect and can sometimes turn up incorrect information. While this situation only occurs for a small percentage of job seekers, it's important for candidates to understand the possibilities and the preventative measures they can take to ensure their background checks adequately reflect their records.

As the founder of eKnowID(Opens in a new window), a self background-checking site site, Iâ€™ve heard it all when it comes to cases of mistaken identity -- here are some of the craziest stories I've com across, illustrating the worst-case scenarios and how you can avoid these fates.

A dramatic first day

Walking into work her first day at the San Diego Country District Attorney's office, a recent law school grad was thrilled to finally start building her career. When she reported to work with high expectations and great enthusiasm, she was immediately handcuffed and taken to jail.

This young woman can thank a faulty background check for her trip behind bars. Someone had stolen her wallet and assumed her identity, and the DA's routine background check revealed an arrest warrant on charges of marijuana possession. The woman had no idea she'd been a victim of identity theft.

The takeaway: Protect your identity(Opens in a new window)! Unfortunately, this story isnâ€™t at all uncommon: The 2013 Identity Fraud Report(Opens in a new window) found 12.6 million victims of identity fraud in 2012, which amounts to about one victim every three seconds.

With the rising number of identity thefts, it is crucial that you protect your personal belongings and information. Credit: Maegan Tintari

In other words, be vigilant with your personal information -- you never know what someone will do with access to your personal data. Make sure youâ€™re careful with the sites you visit, guard your personal information, be careful when sharing computers and always treat your mail with care.

A crushing blow over a mistaken identity

In a tough market, Darlene Martinez finally found the perfect position at a local hospital and was happy to get back on the job. Just one problem: The job offer quickly flew off the table(Opens in a new window). The criminal background check from her employer found that Darlene had a criminal record and a conviction for a drug charge.

Did Darlene have a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde-type split personality? Not quite. The background check actually pulled up the criminal history of a Darlene Ramirez instead. The two shared a common first name and an ""ez"" in their last name, but nothing else.

The takeaway: Take control of your story by running a background check on yourself so that you can nip problems in the bud before they snowball. You need to be proactive, not reactive.

Once you look up your own records, consider submitted (or offering to submit) the correct background check with your application. This way you know exactly what information employers are discovering about your candidacy. Employers are likely to be impressed with your forward-thinking and drive, and youâ€™ll avoid the problems Darlene encountered.

My evil twin did it

When applying for a job, be sure to present all the facts about who you are and where you've been. Credit: Quinn Dombrowski

When working mom Donnie Ward decided to get a part-time job, she didnâ€™t realize it would become a traumatic experience. On her first day, HR called Donnie into the office and accused her of lying on her application about her criminal background. Donnie was asked to leave the premises, even though she explained the information they had was false.

As it turns out, Donnie Ward has a twin brother -- who has a conviction for battery on his record. Like most twins, the two shared a birthday in common, a fact that easily confused the criminal background check. Of course, there was the small difference of gender; but that was clearly something the HR office -- and the background check -- overlooked.

The takeaway: The mix-up between the twins was, at first glance, an easy one to make -- but most candidates assume criminal background checks go deep enough to avoid these mistakes. This assumption could cost you, as national databases have a 41% error rate(Opens in a new window). If you foresee an issue that may cause confusion, warn potential employers before it becomes a bigger problem. This way, employers wonâ€™t immediately discount your candidacy because of a simple misunderstanding.

It is critical that you know and address what's in your background before a misunderstanding or simple error causes you to miss out on a great opportunity.

Would you ever run a background check on yourself? Have you been the victim of a mistaken background check? Share in the comments.

Game of Thrones spends approximately 0.8 minutes of screen time per page, while Friday Night Lights, based on the book by H.G. Bissinger, spends 9.15 minutes per page. Boardwalk Empire, inspired by Nelson Johnson's history of corruption in Atlantic City, spends 8.77 minutes per page.

7009681,Carbon Dioxide Levels Climb Into Uncharted Territory for Humans,"The amount of carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere has exceeded 402 parts per million (ppm) during the past two days of observations, which is higher than at any time in at least the past 800,000 years, according to readings from monitoring equipment on a mountaintop in Hawaii. Carbon dioxide, or CO2, is the most important long-lived greenhouse gas responsible for manmade global warming, and it is building up in the atmosphere due to the burning of fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas.

Once emitted, a single molecule of carbon dioxide can remain aloft for hundreds of years, which means that the effects of today's industrial activities will be felt for the next several centuries, if not thousands of years. Carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, such as methane, warm the planet by absorbing and redirecting outgoing solar radiation that would otherwise escape back into space.

SEE ALSO: 7 Key Findings From the New UN Climate Science Report

In 2013, atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide briefly hit 400 ppm(Opens in a new window) for the first time in mid-May, but this year that symbolic threshold has been crossed even earlier. This means it is more likely that the annual peak, which typically occurs in mid-to-late May, will climb further above 400 ppm for the first time.

Although crossing above 400 ppm is largely a symbolic milestone, scientific research indicates that the higher that carbon dioxide concentrations get, the more global temperatures will increase, resulting in a wide range of damaging effects. These impacts will range from global sea level rise to a heightened risk of heat waves, severe droughts and floods, according to a recently released comprehensive assessment of climate science produced by the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

Modern carbon dioxide monitoring began in 1958 on the peak of Hawaii's Mauna Loa volcano, which is more than two miles high. At that time, carbon dioxide concentrations were at just 313 ppm. They have risen rapidly and steadily since then, both at Mauna Loa and at other observatories around the world. The chart documenting this rise is perhaps the most iconic in all of climate science, known as the ""Keeling Curve"" for Charles David Keeling, the Scripps Institution of Oceanography scientist who began and maintained the monitoring program. Keeling's son, Ralph, is now continuing his father's work, although he has encountered funding difficulties(Opens in a new window) in recent months.

According to the Keeling Curve website(Opens in a new window), carbon dioxide concentrations spiked to 402.20 parts per million on April 7, whereas data(Opens in a new window) from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) showed a slightly lower level of 402.11 parts per million on the same day. Both data sets indicate that daily carbon dioxide measurements have been at or above 400 ppm since March 29, and the graph appears on course to stay above 400 ppm throughout the rest of the month and into the next.

â€œThe underlying significance of all this is that the rate of carbon dioxide increase is higher than ever at the moment, year after year now itâ€™s been more than 2 ppm per year,â€ said Pieter Tans, a senior scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Climate Monitoring and Diagnostics Laboratory in Boulder, Colo. â€œThe increase is manmade â€¦ This is one of the known things about climate change.â€

While studies show conflicting dates(Opens in a new window) for when Earth's atmosphere last had carbon dioxide levels this high, estimates range from 800,000 years ago to 15 million years ago. These estimates resulted from studies of air bubbles recovered in ice cores from deep within Antarctica, Greenland and other glaciers, as well as chemical analyses of coral samples from beneath the sea. Air bubbles trapped in the ice and chemical clues about atmospheric carbon levels in corals have shown that there is now more carbon dioxide in the air than at any other point in the history of human civilization.

â€œCarbon dioxide is higher now in the atmosphere than it has been for millions of years and the rate of increase has not been seen, certainly not in the ice core record going back 800,000 years,"" Tans told Mashable. ""This is truly exceptional compared to times when geology or the natural system prevailed.â€

While the Earth's atmosphere has seen higher levels of carbon dioxide than it does now, as well as higher temperatures and far greater sea levels, those instances were due to natural drivers of climate change, such as periodic variations in the planet's orbit and in solar energy output.

Realizing as much, Discovery Communications, the company behind Animal Planet, has bought an unspecified stake(Opens in a new window) in DogTV, a two-year-old network created with U.S. canines in mind.

The channel broadcasts 24/7, splitting content into three categories: relaxation (think New Age music and a slow-pan of sleeping dogs(Opens in a new window)), stimulation (chirping birds and wrestling puppies(Opens in a new window)) and exposure (busy intersections, babies, postal workers(Opens in a new window), and such).

The target market is humans who feel guilty about leaving pets home alone, and the idea isn't new. A similar product called Puppy Channel was launched in 1997 and still maintains a website. (This American Life produced a great radio profile of its creation(Opens in a new window).)

In August, however, DogTV closed its distribution deal with DirecTV, moving beyond Internet-only status. At the time, DirecTV estimated that half its 20 million customers are dog owners potentially interested in the channel.

To be sure, the market is huge. Some 43.3 million U.S. households(Opens in a new window) have at least one dog. The challenge for the scruffy network is apparent and sizable: how to monetize(Opens in a new window)? Dogs sit outside the 18-49 year-old demographic sweet spot that marketers home in on. Also, they are dogs.

So far, DogTV has gone with the HBO-model, charging a monthly subscription of $5 on DirecTV and $10 for online streaming. The channel may have advertising potential if it can get owners to watch, too.

This isn't Crimea; it's the new eastern Ukraine.

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry on Tuesday accused Russia of ""an illegal and illegitimate effort"" to destabilize Ukraine, after days of protests swept the region.

""Russiaâ€™s clear and unmistakable involvement [...] is more than deeply disturbing,"" Kerry said. ""No one should be fooled, and believe me, no one is fooled by what could potentially be a contrived pretext for military intervention just as we saw in Crimea.""

Kerry compared the unrest in three eastern Ukrainian cities -- Donetsk, Luhansk and Kharkiv -- to the preceding actions that led to a Russian invasion and eventual annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region in the south.

""It is clear that Russian special forces and agents have been the catalyst behind the chaos of the last 24 hours,"" Kerry said.

""The United States and our allies will not hesitate to use 21st-century tools to hold Russia accountable for 19th-century behavior.""

Over the past few days, pro-Russian protesters have stormed government buildings, clashed with police and called for each city's independence from Ukraine.

In Donetsk, several hundred activists broke into the Regional Administration Building and barricaded themselves inside. In Luhansk, the BBC says(Opens in a new window) police battled dozens of protesters who stormed the local security service building in an attempt to free pro-Russia activists who had been arrested earlier in the week. And in Kharkiv, several were injured after dozens of protesters were expelled(Opens in a new window) from the regional state administration building on Tuesday.

""I call this a theater of the absurd,"" Donetsk Governor Serhiy Taruta said of the events(Opens in a new window). ""It is just artists performing, but the main thing is that there is an ever-dwindling audience.""

Ukraine's acting Interior Minister Arsen Avakov, who was in Donetsk to oversee the operation, described it on his Facebook page as an ""anti-terrorist operation"" that occurred ""without firing a shot, grenades or other special weapons.""

Avakov said the operation was a part of a ""broader redeployment in the region"" meant to fight back against the unrest that Russia has been accused -- by both Kerry and Ukraine -- of orchestrating, according to The New York Times(Opens in a new window).

However, the activists at government building in Donetsk say ""not true,"" BuzzFeed's Mike Giglio, who spent the night in the building(Opens in a new window), reports. â€œTell them we are not paid!â€ one 24-year-old reportedly said. â€œAnd they said we were Russian spies â€” it isnâ€™t true.

In response, the Russian Foreign Ministry warned that any use of force from the Ukrainian military could lead to terrible consequences for the country. ""We are calling for the immediate cessation of any military preparations, which could lead to civil war,"" the ministry said in a statement on its website, according to CNN(Opens in a new window).

Russia has been building up its troops just across the border from the three eastern Ukrainian cities, and refused to say why(Opens in a new window).

The buildup in Russia's Rostov and Belgorod regions is substantial, said U.S. Ambassador Daniel B. Baer, the U.S representative to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). He also urged Russia to reduce its troops to pre-crisis numbers and positions.

""The scope of the forces includes not only ground forces, but also forward-deployed air power, providing quick-strike capability and air support to potential ground operations,"" he said in a statement at the Permanent Council, in Vienna on April 7.

NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen warned last week that any Russia intervention further in Ukraine would be a ""historic mistake"" that would ""lead to further international isolation of Russia.""

6869993,"Top EU Court Rejects Metadata Collection Law, Cites Privacy Concerns","The European Union top court struck down a law that required telecom providers to collect subscriber's personal metadata and hold it for up to 2 years, saying it goes against citizens' right to privacy.

The decision(Opens in a new window), issued by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) on Tuesday, addresses the conflict between citizens' civil liberties and the law enforcement agencies' need to access information to investigate crimes. In the wake of the Edward Snowden revelations, countries all over the world are struggling to strike that balance.

SEE ALSO: This Is How the NSA Is Trying to Win Over the Media

The ECJ found that the 2006 European Data Retention Directive(Opens in a new window) directive, issued after the terrorists attacks in Madrid and in London, leaned to far on the side of law enforcement.

""The fact that data are retained and subsequently used without the subscriber or registered user being informed is likely to generate in the persons concerned a feeling that their private lives are the subject of constant surveillance,"" the court said in a statement(Opens in a new window).

The directive was implemented to harmonize practices of data-retention across Europe, with the goal of giving European law enforcement better access to all kinds of telephone and Internet metadata. The ECJ argued that the directive's broad scope violated citizens' ""fundamental rights to respect for private life and to the protection of personal data,"" and was thus ""invalid.""

In fact, the court ruled that the data collected, ""taken as a whole, may provide very precise information on the private lives of the persons whose data are retained, such as the habits of everyday life, permanent or temporary places of residence, daily or other movements, activities carried out, social relationships and the social environments frequented.""

The case reached the ECJ after activists at Digital Rights Ireland(Opens in a new window) and the Austrian Working Group on Data Retention brought challenges against their respective countries.

Civil liberties advocates across Europe celebrated the ruling.

""It is not, and never was, proportionate to spy on the entire population of Europe,"" London-based Internet advocacy group Privacy International said in a press release(Opens in a new window). ""It is right and overdue that this terrible directive was struck down.""

The Open Rights Group, another European advocacy organization, hailed(Opens in a new window) the decision as ""a major victory for privacy rights.""

The ECJ's decision, however, won't have an immediate effect since many EU countries have already adopted the directive with their own national laws. But the ruling opens the door for challenges in every country.

A spokesperson from the European Court of Justice tweeted(Opens in a new window) that it's now up to each country to react to the ruling ""as they see fit.""

Open Rights Group, for example, said it will consider a legal challenge in the UK. The high courts in Germany, Romania and the Czech Republic had already struck down their respective data-retention laws in the past.

In the United States, there is no data-retention law that compels companies to keep data, although many telecom and Internet providers retain certain data for billing and other business-related purposes. That is how the NSA, for example, is able to collect virtually all Americans' phone records, by requesting access to that stored data.

Privacy International as well as other observers hope this ruling can push more countries in Europe, and even across the world, to stop blanket data-retention practices.

""This ruling not only demolishes communications data surveillance laws across Europe, but sets a precedent for the world,"" the group said. ""The widespread and indiscriminate collection of information has been, and always will be bad law, inconsistent with human rights and democratic values.""

7009675,Scientists Raise Odds of El NiÃ±o This Year to at Least 70%,"There is a greater than 70% chance that an El NiÃ±o event will kick off in the equatorial tropical Pacific Ocean during the next four months, the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) said in a long-range forecast(Opens in a new window) released on Tuesday.

El NiÃ±o events are characterized by above average sea surface temperatures in a portion of the tropical Pacific Ocean, and can bring major changes to global weather patterns from the Western U.S. to sub-Saharan Africa.

The Australian forecast comes as scientists studying surface and sub-surface conditions across the tropical Pacific have picked up signs of a potentially rapid transition to what could wind up being a more intense El NiÃ±o event than average.

""... Surface and sub-surface ocean temperatures have warmed considerably in recent weeks, consistent with a state of rapid transition,"" the BOM statement said. ""International climate models surveyed by the Bureau indicate continued warming of the central Pacific Ocean in coming months. Most models predict sea surface temperatures will reach El NiÃ±o thresholds during the coming winter season,"" the Bureau stated, referring to the Southern Hemisphere winter period, or the summer in the Northern Hemisphere.

In Australia, El NiÃ±o events often lead to below average rainfall during the second half of the year, sometimes resulting in widespread droughts. In the U.S., El NiÃ±o events tend to have their biggest influence on winter weather, bringing wetter conditions to the West and Southern tier of the country. This would be potentially good news to drought-stricken areas like California and Texas, although there is no guarantee(Opens in a new window) that an El NiÃ±o would break the drought conditions.

While the BOM said that ""It is too early to determine the strength of this potential El NiÃ±o,"" other scientists have told Mashable that recent developments point toward the upcoming event being a moderate to strong one, if it does indeed take place. The sub-surface ocean conditions in the tropical Pacific resemble conditions in April of 1997, when a record El NiÃ±o was just beginning to develop. Ocean buoys have picked up on an area of unusually mild ocean waters that are moving eastward, past the International Dateline, in a movement known as a downwelling Kelvin Wave(Opens in a new window). Depending on a variety of factors at the surface and sub-surface, these mild waters may reach the surface of the eastern equatorial Pacific during the next few months.

Data showing the progression of the downwelling Kelvin Wave across the tropical Pacific Ocean (area of deep red colors indicate warmer than average ocean temperatures). Credit: Australian Bureau of Meteorology

""Since January, a large volume of warmer-than-average water ... has progressed from the western Pacific sub-surface to the central Pacific sub-surface and warmed, eroding the cooler waters in the east,"" the BOM stated.

""Water below the surface in the central Pacific is now more than 7.2 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than average in some places."" As Mashable reported in March, the Kelvin Wave itself may rank as one of the strongest in the observational record.

Some scientists think this event may even rival the record El NiÃ±o event of 1997-1998. If that does happen, then 2015 would almost be guaranteed to set a record for the warmest year on Earth, depending on the timing of the El NiÃ±o conditions. El NiÃ±o events tend to work in tandem with manmade global warming, both adding heat to the oceans and atmosphere, raising the odds of setting a new temperature record. However, forecasting the intensity of these events months in advance is fraught with uncertainty

Scientists at the BOM and at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in the U.S. had already put the world on notice that an El NiÃ±o event might be taking shape, but the Australian projection is the most confident of any statements issued to date. Making it even more noteworthy is the fact that unlike NOAA, which requires tropical Pacific Ocean waters to be at least 0.9 degrees Fahrenheit above average for at least three straight months before declaring that an El NiÃ±o is underway, the Australians use a tougher standard. The BOM requires three consecutive months with water temperatures of at least 1.44 degrees Fahrenheit above average before they will declare an El NiÃ±o event in progress.

This means that if the Australians are saying there is a 70% chance of an El NiÃ±o developing by winter, it is likely that the next NOAA El NiÃ±o update, which will be released on Thursday, may also raise the odds in favor of such an event.",4/8/2014 0:00,0.526027,7,13,0,4.252011,6,Entertainment,3264.605,7221.763,5067.894,25606.75,0.530176,0.175285,0.032172,0.018767,0.45,0.05,30000
7029445,Facebook Is Making It Easier to Keep Your Private Posts Private,"Facebook is testing a number of new privacy settings intended to better alert users of who they are sharing with on the platform.

The company shared plans on Tuesday for upcoming tests that will alter the way users select the audiences that see the posts they share. On Facebook's web version, users can currently select from a drop-down menu which audience -- ""public"" or ""friends"" -- they want to share their post with.

[seealso slug=""facebook-privacy-dinosaur""]

That drop-down menu will now look different for some users, and groups like ""Public"" and ""Friends"" now include short definitions that better explain what each group entails. (""Public,"" for example, includes ""anyone on or off Facebook."") The company is also testing a pop-up reminder that features a cartoon dinosaur encouraging users to pay attention to this audience setting.

Facebook will also test moving the intended audience label to the top of the post, instead of the lower-righthand corner where it sits now, as a way to ensure its visibility. This strategy has already been implemented on Facebook's mobile apps.

Facebook started testing a new pop-up that includes a blue Privacy Dinosaur reminding people to check who they share with. Credit: Facebook

These changes represent a larger push from Facebook to ease concerns from users who believe the company isn't providing the necessary privacy offerings, or that Facebook's privacy issues change too often, according to Mike Nowak, a product manager on Facebook's privacy team. Nowak wants users to know that Facebook hears their concerns.

""There's an unpleasant surprise when you share things thinking that they're going to be seen by one audience and then somebody you didn't expect interacts with that,"" Nowak says. ""When people have an unpleasant surprise like this, it's bad for them and it's bad for us.""

Nowak says that the company's goals around privacy haven't changed, but its approach has, with Facebook incorporating more feedback from users in order to build out privacy settings. The privacy team, for example, has a screen in its office that surfaces comments and feedback from users, a constant reminder of the issues users are concerned over.

Facebook is also conducting 4,000 privacy-related surveys each day gathering feedback from users to better understand their wants and needs, Nowak says.

What's Dothraki for ""obviously""?

The show's fourth season premiered Sunday to outstanding ratings. The 9 p.m. ET airing garnered 6.6 million viewers (up to 8.2 million after replays), making it the most-viewed TV episode on the network since 12 million people tuned in to The Sopranos finale in 2007.

Even HBO Go buckled under the weight of viewers.

Showrunners David Benioff and Dan Weiss previously told Entertainment Weekly(Opens in a new window) that they intended to wrap the show after seven seasons.

""Once we got to the point where we felt like weâ€™re going to be able to tell this tale to its conclusion, that became [an even clearer] goal,"" Benioff said last month. ""Seven gods, seven kingdoms, seven seasons. It feels right to us.â€

HBO programming president Michael Lombardo also commented to EW that the ""longest HBO shows have gone seven or eight seasons, so seven is a nice long run for us.""

So while Westeros-ites don't have to fear the show getting killed (instead, worry about all the characters getting killed), they do have to fret about Benioff and Weiss catching up to George R.R. Martin's writing.

The author of the A Song of Ice and Fire series, upon which the show is based, has only completed five of the seven novels. But Benioff and Weiss tell Vanity Fair(Opens in a new window) that Martin has filled them in on the major plot points of future books, just in case.

In sum: You'll all be watching the fight for the Iron Throne for many years to come, barring a dragon takeover.

7029336,"Google Glass Is Great for Some Jobs, Google Points Out","Whether or not smart glasses like Google Glass ever gain mainstream acceptance, there's no question they're useful in many jobs. Now Google is taking the conversation about Glass in the workplace to a new level.

Google has begun a Glass at Work initiative, asking businesses how they're working with Glass, and the kinds of applications they're developing. Google's post on Google+(Opens in a new window) cites the Washington Capitals' work with PX Labs, which created Glassware, that shows fans wearing Glass real-time stats, instant replays and different camera angles on the headset.

[seealso slug=""google-glass-pov""]

Most Glass at Work applications, however, will probably look more like what Schlumberger has done, which was also name-checked in the Google post. The oilfield services company partnered with Wearable Intelligence to create Glassware tailored for its employees, so they'll have access to crucial information in the field on a hands-free device.

Using head-mounted displays for specific workplace scenarios is nothing new. The military has been using the tech for years, and scores of Glass Explorers have already shown novel workplace scenarios for Glass. North Carolina firefighter Patrick Jackson, for example, is working on an app(Opens in a new window) that can provide firefighters in the field with potentially lifesaving information, including building floorplans and instructions for dismantling specific cars. And the NYPD is experimenting with cops wearing Glass(Opens in a new window).

Google's announcement of Glass at Work implies the company is interested in tailoring Glass to certain workplace needs, and will probably deploy specific tools for businesses interested in making Glassware.

It also helps shift the conversation about Glass, at least temporarily. Google Glass has been scrutinized for its implications about privacy, and it has suffered some bad press in the past few months, including an incident where a man was ejected from a movie theater and interrogated for wearing the headset, and another where a woman was apparently assaulted for wearing the headset in a San Francisco bar.

By putting the spotlight on developers like Jackson, Google can show the potential benefits of the wearable technology it's pushing forward. Those benefits were perhaps obvious and already in motion, but if it keeps people from talking about Glass and privacy for a few days, it's a win.

In the end, however, Google wants Glass to have mainstream appeal. Glass for Work has its place, but if it becomes the focus, the headset won't ever reach beyond a niche market for a few specialized occupations. In addition to a hands-free camera, Glass provides instant access to Google, communication and the web just by speaking, which has lots of advantages for the everyday user as well.

Google has already begun addressing the issues surrounding privacy and fashion by first forbidding any Glassware that uses facial recognition, then through a partnership with Luxottica, maker of Ray-Ban and Oakley sunglasses, to create more stylish frames for Glass.

There's so far no release date for Glass, although Sergey Brin has previously cited 2014 as the target. The conversation over the next several months will help determine whether the device -- and smart glasses in general -- are destined to have mass appeal or become the equivalent of a hands-free BlackBerry.

Iâ€™m lucky to have had many great teachers, but Kelly Wise, my senior seminar Novel & Drama teacher of Andover stands out above the rest. I remember the enormous personal commitment that was implied just by applying to his class. Everyone knew he required an insane amount of work -- reading piles of books and plays and watching several movies each week; writing, trashing and rewriting papers several times in a row. He had impossibly high standards, but the payoff was well worth it. He pushed all of us so far beyond what any of us thought we were capable of achieving. However, it was the sense of community he built at the same time that stands out the most for me -- I'll never forget my fellow students in that class. Every student deserves a Kelly Wise experience.

Trip Cowin(Opens in a new window), VP of Business Development, Basno(Opens in a new window):

Three days into my tenure as a first grader at Farmingville Elementary School, my parent's received a surprising phone call: ""Trip can't read."" My mother's response, and my teacher's reaction to it, were both direct: ""We know, isn't it your job to teach him?""

Months of hard work later, my teacher, Mrs. Dervin, tasked me with the harrowing role of acknowledging a live audience at the conclusion of our class' rendition of Tikki Tikki Tembo. I was to read from a notecard that Mrs. Dervin had prepared for me, but there was a catch -- I wouldn't be allowed to see the contents of the notecard until that very moment. Successfully navigating through my lines in front a live audience was a thrill I'll never forget. It instilled in me a confidence in my abilities, and a love for reading, that I fostered throughout my academic career. Mrs. Dervin, deservingly so, was acknowledged in my Senior English Thesis at Princeton, which, if you look on a map, is a long ways away from Tikki Tikke Tembo.

Elliot Tomaeno(Opens in a new window), Founder, Astrsk PR(Opens in a new window):

Like many a high school student I was pretty awkward in my sophomore year of high school. I found myself in an AP english class taught by Laura Fore just about at the same time I decided that 'being smart' and 'reading old books' were not things that 'cool kids' did. For my first month in that class I was probably a monster. I didn't read anything, was disruptive during class and was probably super disrespectful to Ms. Fore but for some reason she kept being super kind and patient with me. One day, about a month into class she pulled me aside and said, ""I know you don't think Lord Byron is going to help you here, right now. I know you might find Chaucer irrelevant to your experience here in high school. I know Wuthering Heights can be boring compared to the gossip going around the halls but these authors writings have endured for hundreds of years -- the rumor on the bathroom stall will be painted over by next week, a weak memory by the time you graduate and completely forgotten by the time you enter the workforce. You have finite capacity in that brain of yours -- use it to store and process things of meaning and you live a meaningful life.""

She knew I needed to hear that -- I was torn between who I was and who I felt like my peers expected me to be. Her words hit me hard, and I started reading again and it was through her class that I discovered my love for writing (which probably led me to a career in PR) -- but something in her words struck a deeper chord with me -- and her approach to a 'meaningful life' has stuck with me. She taught me that we have to make choices about what we use our cognitive energy for and that those choices determine the direction of our lives -- this is something that I doubt will ever fade from my memory (unlike the messages on the bathroom stalls -- which she was totally right about).

Kelsey Falter(Opens in a new window), Founder and CEO, PopTip(Opens in a new window):

Mr. Charles Balkcom was my favorite teacher. He demanded nothing short of excellence from my AP English class in high school. He was one of the only teachers who bucked the status quo and encouraged students to truly hone their passions. Mr. Balkcom wasn't afraid to talk to his classes about controversial topics or encourage independent thinking. Even before online grading systems provided transparency, he stood by providing transparent grading metrics for his class and never made students wait to know their progress on an assignment. Nobody had any questions about their personal weaknesses or strengths, and everyone had a clear understanding of expectations for improvement. That level of transparency around academic progress is incredibly important. Most importantly, Mr. Balkcom took pride in his work. He never let someone else's textbook guide his course. He never took the easy way out. His high expectations, his transparent (and timely) grading, and his commitment to bringing his absolute best to each lecture or discussion is what made students in class want to do their best in his course. Mr. Balkcom was the epitome of what it means to inspire and lead. And I will never forget the example that he set for his students.

Steve Eidelman(Opens in a new window), Co-Founder and Head of Product, Whistle(Opens in a new window):

Mr. Strouse was the first teacher to show me the value of telling stories as the most effective way of understanding and analyzing a problem rather than simply reciting facts. For years, I thought school was about memorizing answers and formulas, but Mr. Strouse told us really compelling stories. Sounds simple, but in reality, most teachers don't approach teaching this way. Everything we did in class made us feel like we were reenacting a moment. He would pace the room waving his hands, while his voice vacillated. It was intense, and I genuinely felt like I was experiencing a moment in time. The goal wasn't just to make learning fun -- it was to empathize with the various people, organizations, companies, and countries involved in whatever event or era we were studying. Once I got to college, I realized how critical empathy was to so many things I studied. It made thinking through a problem easier and made writing flow more freely. It helped explain the why and made working with others more natural.

Debbie Sterling(Opens in a new window), Founder, GoldieBlox(Opens in a new window):

Like most high school students entering college, I didn't know what I wanted to study. When my math teacher mentioned I might like engineering, I looked at her like she was crazy. An engineer, I thought, was certainly some nerdy guy calculating algorithms in front of computer screens all day. Being an engineer certainly wasn't a path for a creative girl like myself! Nevertheless, her advice stuck with me, and I enrolled in Mechanical Engineering 101 during my first semester at Stanford University. In less than one class, I soon realized my high school math teacher was right along. Engineering -- it turns out -- is an amazing outlet for creativity and innovation. Without my teacher's encouragement, there's a good chance I wouldn't have discovered the wonderful world of STEM and all it has to offer.

I was never a good student until I met Mr. Greco. Up until the seventh grade, it was always tough for me to stay motivated but he inspired me to study hard, stay focused and be determined not to fail. My desire to make him proud was what drove me to my success in his class, and beyond it. When people ask me what I attribute my success to today I say it's three things: hard work, focus, and a love of what I do. What I don't always mention and I'm glad I am able to share now, is that I learned those integral lessons early on, from my seventh grade teacher Mr. Greco.

Ryan Hayward(Opens in a new window), Co-Founder, Hatch(Opens in a new window):

Mr. Laitenberger was the first teacher I had who directly challenged me to be better, not just as a student, but as a person. As my eighth grade social studies teacher, he had a ruthless homework lateness policy that resulted in the lowest score I ever received on a report card; a 78! He was also the school track coach and at 12 years old I was not the most physically active, so he challenged me to join the cross country team and â€œlose my baby fat.â€ Yes, he actually said that!

I learned from Mr. L. that ability and vision is necessary in the equation, but it is ultimately execution that matters. You can be perfectly capable of doing something and may have demonstrated past performance, but if you don't seize the initiative and continue to work at it, you'll just be mediocre, or worse, never take that next big risk. This lesson has stayed with me throughout adulthood and into my career, through my five years at Google, until most recently when I made a life-changing move to start a company.

Gaia Dempsey,(Opens in a new window) Co-Founder and VP of Marketing, DAQRI(Opens in a new window):

In 10th grade, I had a truly fantastic English teacher who, over time and with a decent amount of prodding from the class, told us his lifeâ€™s story. Dharma Dass had always been extremely smart and driven growing up, and after graduating from college quickly took a job on Wall Street as a financial analyst making a cushy salary. He got married to a very beautiful girl very shortly after graduation, and generally felt pretty self-satisfied about his â€œprogress"" ticking off the items of lifeâ€™s checklist. However, not long into the marriage, everything started to unravel. The relationship couldnâ€™t handle the stress of his 90-hour work weeks, and the couple didnâ€™t have the kind of solid foundation thatâ€™s only possible when two people truly know themselves before flinging themselves into a relationship. One day, he decided to share some of his lessons learned and explain to us what actually makes a marriage work. Most people would say that love is the most important component, but not Dharma Dass. He considered love to be a prerequisite certainly, but not the real crux of the matter where the rubber meets the road. Instead, marriage depends on three things, he told us: food, clothing, and shelter.

First off, food. If you canâ€™t agree on what kind of food you like, thatâ€™s a minimum of 365 fights a year right off the bat. And itâ€™s not just about the kind of food, but itâ€™s also about your habits, where you like to eat, if you prefer cooking or dining out, and so on. Thereâ€™s no right or wrong answer, he said, you just have to be on the same page about it. When it comes to clothing, he asked us, how much do you as a person care about fashion? Would you, or your partner member be embarrassed if your counterpart showed up to an event in Birkenstocks? Again, it doesnâ€™t really matter where you fall on the spectrum because itâ€™s a completely personal choice. But if you're too far out of alignment with each other, the relationship will suffer from a lot of unnecessary tension and frustration. Shelter is about the big priorities. Does one of you want to structure your lives in such a way that you focus a significant amount of time working in order to buy your dream home, while the other doesnâ€™t care if you live in a shack by the river? You can see how that wouldn't work.

The concept that a marriage works best when predicated on the couple wanting the same things in life seems pretty basic to me now, but in 10th grade these ideas opened my eyes to a completely new way of thinking about relationships, priorities, and the big life decisions. Itâ€™s one of countless episodes where this teacher made me think and question my assumptions about what I knew. As a mentor, his contribution to my life was pretty much irreplaceable.",4/8/2014 0:00,0.483703,6,1,1,4.573436,10,Lifestyle,2597.848,5463.4,4109.391,1600,0.489262,0.17709,0.052363,0.012771,0.4,-0.4,1600

Congress has controlled the house via a coalition with other parties since 2004, but corruption allegations and a struggling economy have given the rival Bharatiya Janata Party a chance to gain the upper hand.

This election will decide which politicians will fill the 543 Lok Sabha seats, and ultimately, who will become the next prime minister. Each party -- and there are many more than two in India, although Congress and the BJP are the most powerful -- can select a prime-minister candidate; that candidate moves into the nation's highest office if his or her party wins more seats than any other.

Part of the BJP's success comes from India's rising urban middle class(Opens in a new window). The BJP is seen as a representative of this up-and-coming class, as opposed to the more traditional Congress.

But the BJP's prime-minister candidate is a traditionalist in his own right. Narendra Modi, who has won three straight elections(Opens in a new window) as the chief elected official in the northwestern state of Gujarat, is unabashedly a Hindu nationalist. At one point, he was accused of directing violence against Muslims across his state, although an investigation absolved him of any wrongdoing. He gained popularity as an official who increased economic development across Gujarat, according to the Global Post(Opens in a new window), and many hope he will do the same for the nation.

Modi's chief competitor comes from the India's most famous political family. Rahul Gandhi's great-grandfather, Jawaharlal Nehru, was India's first prime minister, and his grandmother and father were also named prime minister(Opens in a new window). His mother is the current president of the Congress party.

Gandhi is Congress' current vice-president, and although he has led the electoral campaign for his party, he has not officially announced himself(Opens in a new window) as its prime-minister candidate. At 43, he is 20 years younger than Modi, and there are major concerns about his ability to govern(Opens in a new window) a nation of 1.2 billion people, should he become prime minister. He grew up with privileges many of his countrymen didn't share, attended Harvard University and Cambridge University, and some believe he is too out of touch with common citizens to be an effective leader.

Gandhi became a politician in 2004 when he was elected a member of parliament representing the district of Amethi in the state of Uttar Pradesh, but has little experience carrying out policies, according to The Guardian(Opens in a new window). In a recent interview, he said he hopes to empower India's women and youth.

Plenty of outcomes lie at the end of the vote. Although it appears Modi and the BJP will most likely win(Opens in a new window), there is an ever-so-slim possibility that Arvind Kejriwal and his upstart Aam Aadmi Party could make a splash on the national scene just as they did last year at local elections in Delhi, the nation's capital, where AAP candidates pushed an anti-corruption platform, and won enough seats to briefly grasp control there.

7029439,Indiegogo's New Logo Will Now Feature Different User Campaigns,"Lots of companies claim they put their users first, but Indiegogo is trying to prove it.

The crowdfunding platform is changing its website design and logo to feature a different Indiegogo campaign each time someone visits the site.

The new logo, which was first revealed last week at an event in San Francisco, is an attempt to put users at the forefront, says Shannon Swallow, head of marketing and communications at Indiegogo.

All campaigns that have been completed on the site, regardless of whether or not they hit their funding goal, may appear within the logo, which features a hot pink color the company calls ""gogenta."" When the logo is seen offline (for example, at company headquarters) the square will be empty.

The campaign photos even appear as part of the logo on employee business cards.

""We really believe the customer is such a [huge] part of our identity,"" says Swallow. ""We started looking at 'how do we make that more integrated with our site, our vision, our identity and our logo?'""

The logo is part of a much bigger rebrand that includes a completely redesigned webpage. The new look is more visual and less text-heavy than the site's old look. It will appear, in near entirety, on Indiegogo's mobile and tablet versions of the site as well. (Some text-heavy pages, like the consumer dashboard, will be optimized during a future update.)

7029412,All the World's a Game: Interactive Map Gives Kids the Travel Bug,"Simon Schuetz didn't know Easter Island was a real place until he was 15, but the statue-laden land became the best trip he ever took once he finally saw it with his own eyes years later.

Now the German expat, who currently lives in Bali, wants to inspire lifelong exploration in a younger generation with an interactive map that not only teaches kids what they should learn about the world, but also tries to anticipate what they might actually want to know.

[seealso slug=""food-map""]

""I was always fascinated by maps,"" Schuetz told Mashable. ""They challenge your boundaries, you can see places you can't otherwise see. You start to wonder about different places, what they might be.""

In its final incarnation, Kidsmap will function both as a game and a map. The 38"" x 22"" board will feature a simplified rendering of the world that highlights topographical features, such as deserts, tundras or mountain ranges. It will include approximately 140 re-attachable stickers (drawn by Schuetz' business partner, illustrator Lars Seiffert), which showcase anything from famous landmarks to animals indigenous to different regions of the world, and an equal amount of quiz cards with facts spanning from wildlife to technology.

Schuetz expects that everyone will use Kidsmap differently, but he is working with game designers to develop a few different suggestions. A Kickstarter(Opens in a new window) campaign, which launched Tuesday, will raise funds for production.

Schuetz hopes Kidsmap will inspire children to explore the world. He doesn't have a checklist of things he wants kids to learn from the map; he just wants to get them excited about adventure. If kids associate an interest with a geographic location, they might be more inclined to actually travel. The key, he believes, is simplicity: Sticking to the basics and not loading the map with oodles of extra information and illustrations.

This concept of clarity isn't new. Jim McMahon (a.k.a. ""Mapman(Opens in a new window)""), senior cartographer at Scholastic Classroom Magazines, creates maps that appear in the company's 28 magazines geared toward specific age groups, from kindergartners to high school students. He stressed the importance of making a map appropriate for the audience it is intended for; for example, young children often do best with simple shapes, while teenagers can handle more detail.

Kidsmap is intended for kids ages 5 to 10, a significant age gap at such a young age, and McMahon wonders if it will effectively appeal to both ends of the spectrum. Regardless, Schuetz believes that the younger a child is exposed to travel the better, so as to cement the importance of exploration.

So far, about 20 kids have taken Kidsmap for a trial run. The beta testers include twins Myles and Austin Wall, who at 10 years old are already seasoned travelers. They have been to a total of 21 countries so far. Their father, Peter Wall, was pleased with the product.

""They love to travel and they love games so it's a deadly combination for them,"" he told Mashable. ""It doesn't feel like you're learning, it feels like you're playing.""

An avid traveler, Schuetz has lived in Switzerland, the U.S., Peru, Brazil and Chile before moving to Bali, but wishes that he had started earlier. Maps, he believes, are not just a means of getting from one place to another, but can be the beginning of adventures. His startup, Awesome Maps(Opens in a new window), has seen great success in past projects. A bucket list map(Opens in a new window) that suggests can't-miss activities in different regions of the world raised nearly $60,000 on Kickstarter(Opens in a new window) in July, significantly more than its $8,000 goal.

Part of Kidsmap's charm is its tactility; it's not an app or computer game. Wall, the father of the 10-year-old twins, said he has tried a number of geography quiz apps, but didn't feel a desire to return to them. Plus, he said, Myles and Austin are active kids who respond to physical products like Kidsmap.

""Every physical product has this emotional reaction you can lose when it's digital,"" Schuetz said. ""It's free of distractions, you can see the whole thing, you can touch it, you can move it around.""

Schuetz wants Kidsmap to be a map of the world made by the people of the world. He will be taking suggestions about what to feature on the stickers from Kickstarter backers.

If the campaign is successful, a basic version of Kidsmap will cost about $35, and will be sold on the Awesome Maps website as early as August.",4/8/2014 0:00,0.441506,12,4,4,4.854167,4,00000,2219.468,3573.4,2716.287,3533.333,0.411656,-0.00048,0.020833,0.022817,0.5,0.5,1100

The newest version of the app reflects the company's recent shift from focusing on measuring individuals' Klout scores, to actively helping its users raise their scores.

[seealso slug= ""why-klout-had-to-change/""]

While the previous version of the app emphasized fluctuations in your Klout score and areas of influence, the updated app helps users expand their influence in topics they care about. The new app provides a platform for users to share relevant content with their connections.

""We really want to be a utility that helps people,"" Klout cofounder and former CEO Joe Fernandez told Mashable. ""It's hard to figure out what to say that's relevant and timely that your audience will be into.""

Users select the topics they care about and the app provides a curated stream of content they can can share with their followers. The app highlights articles that are especially well-suited to a user's audience. If more than 25% of your Twitter followers are interested in technology, for example, the app flags articles likely to share well with your audience.

Q&A with Major League Baseball

Mashable: When did Major League Baseball start Snapchatting and why? What drew you to the platform?

Hali Stark: MLB joined Snapchat in February around the start of spring training. We had been interested in the platform, knowing a lot of our fans were there, and we had the ability to reach a different demographic. Spring training was the perfect time to start the account. Itâ€™s a more laid-back environment for players and fans, and it gave us the ability to capture a part of baseball that not every fan gets to experience.

What is unique about Snapchat? How do you think it differs from other forms of social media?

Every social platform serves a purpose. Finding that purpose for Snapchat was important to us before joining because itâ€™s such a personal experience.

What makes Snapchat unique is the combination of features it offers, and the way that people use the app to communicate. When creating a strategy, we wanted to apply how we use it personally, and how we think our fans use it. We snap as if we were just another friend (who happens to have great access to baseball players). MLB doesnâ€™t break news on Snapchat, or take the most artistic photos -- we try to create lighthearted, in-the-moment photos or videos that show off the personality of our players and the game.

How do you decide what to snap? What do you like featuring on your Snapchat stories?

Obviously, you have to be present to take a snap, so depending on where our team travels, we try to find the most interesting, fun storyline of the day. Then we try to capture it combining the right emojis, drawings or creative text. We craft all of our snaps to make fans feel like they are getting an exclusive message straight from MLB or the player.

Some of our most popular snaps have been players interacting with the camera. Whether itâ€™s them dancing, high-fiving or waving, fans feel as if that particular player is sending them a personal message. Snapchat gives us the opportunity to showcase our playersâ€™ personalities and create personal connections for fans that arenâ€™t quite possible on other platforms or in real life.

How does Snapchat lend itself to sports coverage?

Snapchat is perfect for sports. While it's not ideal for live-game coverage, it gives sports brands a completely new way to create connections with fans. We see how Snapchat is changing the way our fans communicate and if our fans are there, then we want to be there, too. We look forward to seeing how the app changes in the future, and weâ€™ll be ready to adjust and innovate with any new features down the road.",4/8/2014 0:00,0.592466,3,0,1,4.467797,6,Entertainment,631,3573.4,2420.357,8100,0.556,-0.007,0.027119,0.037288,0,0,918

The bug was reportedly discovered by a member of Google's security team and a software security firm called Codenomicon(Opens in a new window).

A number of other websites, according to a list(Opens in a new window) making the rounds on GitHub, may be vulnerable to the bug as well.

The bug affects web servers running Apache and Nginx software, and it has the potential to expose private information users enter into websites, applications, web email and even instant messages.

And while most security experts advise that you always use websites and services offering SSL security encryption whenever possible, the Heartbleed bug has the ability to allow malicious operators to defeat this security layer and capture passwords as well as forge authentication cookies and obtain other private information.

A security patch(Opens in a new window) for the bug was announced on Monday(Opens in a new window), but many websites are still playing catch up.

7027609,What Happened to Flight 370? 5 Leading Theories,"One month into the search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, and there's still no sign of the Boeing 777. Investigators are focusing on a handful of scenarios that could have led to the airliner's fate, but they admit that we may never know what really transpired in those final hours. Was the plane hijacked? Did a crew member deliberately crash the jet? Is it ... still out there?

A few days after the plane's disappearance, Mashable collected all the possible theories on what happened. One month later, we've ruled out a few of them. Here's the updated list.

Possible

1. It was hijacked by a member of the crew.

Malaysian authorities have ended their investigation into all 227 passengers on board the plane and cleared all of suspicion. This now leaves the plane's crew, including senior pilot Zaharie Ahmad Shah, 53, and his co-pilot Fariq Abdul Hamid, 27, both of whom are still under investigation. Police chief Khalid Abu Bakar told reporters(Opens in a new window) that the criminal investigation was now focused on four possible scenarios, one of which is a hijacking. If it was hijacked, though, what was the plan? That much investigators don't know. Most hijackings end with a ransom exchange or, as we saw on 9/11, a much more public display of destruction. MH370, it appears, ended in the Indian Ocean.

2. It was sabotaged by a member of the crew.

Given reports that the plane's communications transponders were deliberately turned off -- one after the other -- investigators believe sabotage is a possibility. Someone on board seemingly changed the plane's course -- and deliberately masked its location from radar systems. The Wall Street Journal's Jon Ostrower says(Opens in a new window) turning off the plane's transponder ""would require disabling a circuit breaker above and behind an overhead panel. Pilots rarely, if ever, need to access the circuit breakers, which are reserved for maintenance personnel.""

Who turned off the transponders? Investigators don't know, but they believe someone with knowledge of a Boeing 777's cockpit was responsible for the deliberate action.

3. A crew member had a financial or personal motive to crash the plane.

The disappearance of the flight may be the result of psychological or personal problems of someone on board, said police chief Bakar. ""Maybe somebody on the flight has bought a huge sum of insurance, who wants family to gain from it or somebody who has owed somebody so much money,"" he proposed(Opens in a new window) at a news conference days after the plane vanished. If that's the case, investigators will likely review who's getting paid what from insurance companies -- and zero in a suspect from there. As The New York Times(Opens in a new window) reported on April 1, the payout process has already started.

4. The pilot committed suicide.

Though uncommon, there have been 24 cases of in-flight pilot suicide(Opens in a new window) over the last two decades. SilkAir Flight 185 and EgyptAir Flight 990 are the two commonly cited examples of this type of tragedy. In both cases, investigators concluded that the pilots deliberately caused the crashes.

5. A catastrophic event killed passengers and crew, subsequently causing the plane to crash.

Since the very beginning of the search, authorities have said that whatever happened on board the plane unfolded quickly. Satellite data showed that the plane flew off radar for up to seven hours -- meaning that the plane continued traveling until its fuel ran out. It's possible that everyone on board was unconscious or dead due to explosive, rapid or slow decompression, which can occur from any number of instances while traveling in an aircraft.

One of the more notorious decompression-related airplane crashes in recent memory was the Learjet crash that killed professional golfer Payne Stewart in October 1999. While investigators never concluded what caused the decompression itself, what's certain is that the pilots were rendered incapacitated due to a lack of oxygen in the plane (which can occur in minutes if a cabin were to slowly lose pressure). The pilots â€” and their passengers â€” died of hypoxia, a deadly condition caused by low oxygen conditions. The plane, however, continued to fly on autopilot for hours. It eventually ran out of fuel and crashed into a field.

It's possible this happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, especially given the news that the jet's engines continued to send data for four more hours after the last contact.

Conspiracy theories

It's at Diego Garcia U.S. military base.

Some have speculated that the plane was hijacked and landed at a U.S. military base on Diego Garcia, a small coral atoll in the Indian Ocean. At one point in the investigation, police were looking into Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah's flight simulator, and reportedly(Opens in a new window) found the small island's landing strip programmed into the computer -- suggesting Captain Shah may have practiced a virtual landing. However, Malaysia's acting Transport Minister Hishamuddin Hussein downplayed the rumors(Opens in a new window) on March 16, ruling out the theory that the plane was there and its hijackers were seeking a ransom.

It's on the Afghanistan-Pakistan border

An anonymous source who works somewhere in the ""security services,"" reportedly told Moskovskij Komsomolets, a Moscow-based daily newspaper known for its sensationalist coverage of world events, that a Malaysian passenger named ""Hitch"" hijacked the plane(Opens in a new window) and landed it safety(Opens in a new window) in Pakistan. The passengers were reportedly taken to the mountainous region to the southeast of the Afghan city of Kandahar, and the plane remains on a small dirt runway with a broken wing -- the result of a hard landing. The paper claims that the reason for the hijacking was blackmail: There are 20 ""Asian specialists"" on board who are now being used ""for bargaining with the Americans or the Chinese.""

Launched on October 25, 2001, Windows XP is one of the most successful Microsoft products ever; its successor, Windows Vista, was quickly replaced with Windows 7, and it took as long as September 2012 for Windows 7 to overtake XP as the most popular desktop operating system.

Microsoft released three Service Packs for Windows XP; the last one, SP3, was launched in May 2008. In April 2009, Microsoft ended Mainstream Support for the OS, meaning it stopped providing free technical support and accepting warranty claims. Up until today, the company provided Extended Support, which included paid technical support and security updates.

What does it mean for the end user? Simply put, you can continue to use Windows XP and Office 2003, but as time goes on, they will be more and more vulnerable to malware and other security risks.

For users still running Windows XP, Microsoft recommends upgrading their PC to a model that can run the latest version of Windows, 8.1.

The iOS game Monument Valley -- iTunes' current top spot holder for paid apps in the U.S. -- is not that game. This contemplative, bewitching game is meant to be played quietly on the couch, with headphones on. It fully plunges the player into a puzzling world with levels that please your ears, eyes and sense of touch.

Monument Valley is a game where players lead a princess through a serious of twisted, mind-bending structures. Tapping directs the white-clad princess, but much of each level requires non-directed experimenting as players must manipulate pieces of each of monument as a giant puzzle to get to the goal.

Why Monument Valley is meant to be played slowly is the the way each pull and prod of the environment elicits different sounds. Pulling a platform across a void brings out a string of notes, but the greater surprise was discovering the speed of movement affected the tempo of the music. The game's design leads to endless small surprises in the gameplay as you learn exactly what you can manipulate.

As you lead Princess Ida through each increasingly difficult level, you'll find pieces of the story of the abandoned Monument Valley. Each level is also a visual delight, despite the haunting desertion.

7009426,"Iran Enters New Round of Nuclear Talks With U.S., World Powers","Iran entered a third round of nuclear talks with world powers on Tuesday that will run from April 8 to 9 in Vienna, Austria, but whether the nations will soon be able to start hammering out a final agreement regarding the future of Iran's nuclear program is unclear.

Officials from the United States and Iran were both optimistic that the nations would be able to start work on a final contract by mid-May, according to Reuters(Opens in a new window). The two sides hope this will be the last discussion regarding what the contract should include and that future talks will be about agreeing to it. Russian officials, however, reportedly said the talks are very much in initial stages(Opens in a new window).

Representatives from the United States, Russia, Germany, France, China, the United Kingdom and Iran have been discussing the future of Iran's nuclear program since mid-February(Opens in a new window) of 2014.

The talks surround the future of Iran's nuclear program, which officials there say is meant only as a means to produce electricity. Many other nations fear Iran is working to produce a nuclear weapon, especially longtime U.S. ally Israel, which sees Iran as a threat and has threatened to strike(Opens in a new window) its nuclear facilities if talks break down. Experts at the Center for Strategic and International Studies believe Iran is already capable of striking anywhere in Israel with its arsenal of missiles, so Iran's possession of a nuclear bomb would be perceived as a terminal threat.

Below, a video provided to Mashable produced by the CSIS and put together based on research gathered by narrator and Iran military expert Anthony Cordesman, demonstrates the reach of Iran's missiles and some of the concerns Israel has about its rival's military capabilities.

Iran has come to the negotiating table to try to end sanctions that have deeply damaged its economy(Opens in a new window). The six nations seek to convince Iran to roll back its nuclear capabilities so it cannot quickly produce an atomic bomb. In November, 2013, the two sides reached an interim deal in which sanctions would be eased for a six-month discussion period that would hopefully lead to a broader agreement. That period began in January, and the two sides have until July 20(Opens in a new window) until the talks end and sanctions are re-imposed.

Despite the optimism from some American and Iranian officials, Iran has not indicated it is willing to stop enriching uranium, according to Reuters(Opens in a new window), a key step in the creation of a nuclear bomb.

The talks also do not include the Israeli government, which has taken a hardline stance against Iran's uranium enrichment. It has also been suggested that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu does not want the talks to end in an agreement(Opens in a new window), because an Iran with any nuclear capacity is an existential threat to Israel.

â€œThe U.S. is really trying to bring these opposing sides closer together,"" Sharon Squassoni, director of the proliferation prevention program at CSIS, told Mashable. ""Israel is asking for a lot and thereâ€™s going to have to be compromise on both sides. So you wonâ€™t get, for example, Iran to forego a civilian nuclear program. Itâ€™s just not going to happen.â€

If there's going to be a deal, Squassoni said Iran must ""walk back"" its nuclear program.

7008266,"United by soccer, kids from 32 countries fight for a field","OAKLAND, Calif. -- The soccer players at Oakland International High School speak 33 languages and come from 32 different countries. The beautiful game unites them, but they can't play it the way other kids do because their school lacks a key facility: a pitch.

The students, who are refugees, asylees and recent immigrants from far-flung places like Iraq, Afghanistan and Nigeria, have grown fed up with the skinned knees and missed practices that come with playing on asphalt. So they've banded together in an online, grassroots campaign to petition the Oakland School Board to help them build a proper place to play.

SEE ALSO: Indestructible Soccer Ball Brings Sport to Kids Who Need It Most

With the help of Ben Gucciardi, who leads their Soccer Without Borders(Opens in a new window) program, and Principal Carmelita Reyes, the students formed a leadership committee, built a website(Opens in a new window), and started a Change.org petition(Opens in a new window).

The resulting, student-led movement for a field is characterized by cooperation across continents and around language barriers. Yasser, a 17-year-old student from Yemen, built the site through Wix, a cloud-based development platform, complete with testimonials and photography. He and Solomon, 17, of Liberia, shot and edited a video for it, below, which they posted to YouTube.

In an email, Yasser said he stopped playing on the soccer team when he ""got hurt badly on the cement,"" which is what inspired him to help his fellow students in their quest for a field of their own.

With over 2,000 signatures, the OIHS petition got the attention of the school board, whose members have been meeting individually with the students, many of whom come from places where this kind of civic engagement would be far-fetched, if not impossible.

Even with the cooperation of school officials, though, the request is complicated. The cramped stretch of concrete reserved for soccer is surrounded by a chain link fence separating it from a state-of-the-art baseball field that OIHS soccer players are not welcome to use. It's part of Oakland Technical High School, another public school nearby, and soccer cleats tear up the grass, which is expensive to repair.

A group of enterprising Oakland Tech parents began to raise the money to build what's now Rickey Henderson Field in 2005, when it was just an empty lot at an abandoned middle school. The school district, then under state administration, agreed to let them build the field with the money they'd raised, which they continue to maintain. But, in 2007, OIHS opened as a public school(Opens in a new window) for Oakland's immigrant community -- that relegates the 100 or so students who play together as part of Soccer Without Borders(Opens in a new window) to the concrete lot.

The students and their parents will meet with stakeholders from Oakland Tech and school board members on Tuesday, in an effort to forge a way forward that will benefit both teams, both schools and the larger community. Oakland International students are asking the school board to build a solution that will work for all students. It could involve simply putting turf over the small lot they now have or, additionally, building a retractable fence to make part of the baseball field multi-use.

That has raised eyebrows among baseball boosters and, with so much invested on all sides and limited resources, there is tension at play. The baseball coach recently told a local reporter(Opens in a new window) the students were ""opportunistic"" for wanting to ""stake a claim"" to the Oakland Tech field, and other reports(Opens in a new window) have largely focused on conflict.

Conflict, however, is not what defines the OIHS team, though many of its players have and continue to overcome great hardship. Ravis, a 16-year-old from Congo who resettled in the U.S. three years ago, talked about the bonds he has formed playing the game. ""It's making me feel like a family here,"" he said. ""One thing that we all have in common is we love each other.""

A group of young women from the team and places like Burma, Nepal, Somalia and Eritrea agreed that playing soccer together helps them learn English, other languages and make friends.

""When I first arrived in United States, I didn't have any friends. And also I didn't speak English,"" Gaby, an 18-year-old from Guatemala, said before ending the day holding her own at midfield with the boys' teams. Like Ravis, the girls remarked that they liked the way playing at Oakland International brought people from different religions, countries and cultures together; that they were ""like a family.""

When it comes to competing interests and space limitations, though, love and determination may not be enough. The Oakland Tech community, understandably, has its own petition underway(Opens in a new window) to keep the baseball field in its ""current configuration.""

Jody London, the school board member for the district stresses that there is no easy answer. ""Iâ€™m very interested in making sure that we have space for everything -- but i donâ€™t know if the site at Oakland International can accommodate everything people want it to be,"" she said in an interview.

Though a solution is not clear, the students play on. When asked why he wanted to help encourage the school board to approve a pitch, Solomon, the student from Liberia, replied in an email:

I myself used to be on the soccer team and know how difficult it is to play without a soccer field. We move around a lot. We sometimes play on concrete, which has injured a lot of our players including myself. Because of the lack of field, we sometimes go around trying to find a field to play on and by the time we get it, there will be about only 30 minutes left to play. This is very discouraging and it feels very bad. Almost like we're homeless.

Furthermore, I know how much soccer means to my fellow mates because from where we come from, soccer is everything. Also, it helps our students connect with each other and prevents conflicts. Given that most of us have only been here for 3 years or less, it's hard to communicate at first. However, soccer creates a new and easier language for all of us to communicate with.

As for the ultimate goal, there remain months of bargaining to be done, bureaucracy to be navigated and concessions to be made -- on all sides. But Graciela, a 17-year-old from Mexico who's been in the U.S. for five years, says Oakland International students have a plan.

""Our strategy, it's to just stay calm and don't really listen to their negative words,"" she said in an interview. ""It's gonna be hard,"" but the pressure of advocating for herself and her teammates hasn't rattled her. ""I think we're gonna get our soccer field.""",4/8/2014 0:00,0.680556,12,7,0,4.938356,7,00000,0,9594.234,5508.896,2100,0.595455,0.090303,0.034247,0.020548,0.75,0.3,1700

7029180,Samsung Galaxy S5 Is the Upgrade You Can Skip,"The Samsung Galaxy S5 is boring. While its competitors, Android flagships such as the HTC One M8 and Google Nexus 5, stake out their territory with a couple of standout features, the GS5 wants it all. Bells and whistles, however, don't necessarily add up to a great experience.

And Samsung pulled out plenty of bells and whistles. The smartphone, which goes on sale April 11 in the U.S. on every major wireless carrier, is notable for being the first mobile device to offer a heart-rate monitor. There's also a fingerprint sensor. The camera has a new, faster kind of autofocus. And it's waterproof! Pretty sweet, right?

It should be. However, with each supposedly standout feature, I couldn't help but think about how they didn't really make the phone stand out that well. Other phones have most of them, by and large with better execution. Those phones may not have specs that are quite as good, but they've got more flavor.

At 5.1 inches, the screen on the Galaxy S5 is just a bit larger than the Galaxy S4. It packs a quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 processor with 2GB of RAM. The internal storage is 16GB, but you can supplement that with a microSD card. The rear camera snaps images at 16-megapixel resolution, and impressively, it can capture 4K (3,840 x 2,160) footage. The front camera is 2.1 megapixels.

[nggallery id=15857]

If setting up yet another smartphone sounds like a nightmare to you, you're in luck: Samsung makes it easy to get started via the Smart Switch app. It even works with iPhones by letting you log into your iCloud account to gather your Contacts, Calendar and email. And if there are Android equivalents of your apps, it'll download those, too.

Designing Right

The Galaxy S5 gets on your good side right away with a design that's simply outstanding. At 5.1 ounces and 0.32 inches thin, its size-to-mass ratio feels dead on. Although it's technically wider than the HTC One M8, it's easier to hold because it's so light.

The grooved metallic trim on the outside may look a little retro, but as a tactile experience, it makes a hell of a difference. Your fingers will almost always have a sure grip, which helps considerably when operating the phone with one hand. The plastic backside of the phone, which is removable, is nothing special, although the dotted pattern is a refreshing change from Samsung's recent design addiction to faux-leather trim.

The display is incredible. I say that with the caveat that the displays on all flagship Android phones today are incredible. They're all around 5 inches, and they all have full HD resolution (1,920 x 1,080). Colors really pop on the Galaxy S5's Super AMOLED screen, although it tends to give whites a slightly bluish tinge.

Unlike many other Android manufacturers, Samsung opts for a home button on its Galaxy phone, and the S5 follows that pattern. It must because it needs the button for one of its marquee features: a fingerprint sensor.

Credit: Mashable, Will Fenstermaker

Samsung's fingerprint sensor -- the first time the company has offered the feature on a smartphone -- is conceptually the same as the one on the iPhone 5S. You can store multiple fingerprints, and their primary purpose is to ease the oft-repeated task of unlocking your phone 30-odd times a day, potentially saving time and hassle.

On the iPhone 5S, this typically works fine since the sensor on the home button has a large enough surface area to catch a decent fingerprint no matter how you press it. Not so on the Galaxy S5: You need to slide your finger downwards over the button to activate it, similar to the sensor on the HTC One Max.

It sounds comparable, but it's night and day. I'd say the failure rate for my index finger and thumb was greater than 50%. The phone was constantly telling me to swipe slower, wipe the pad or simply that my digit wasn't a match for the prints stored. For my pinky finger, the failure rate was more like 90%. Once you hit five strikes, you're shunted to your alternative password, which is even harder to enter than a PIN.

Camera Trouble

Samsung worked hard on the GS5's camera. A good camera is one of the top features people look for in a smartphone, and manufacturers walk a fine line. Put in too many features, and users get flummoxed. Too few, and competitors will easily outdo you.

And there's a great camera on this device, but it's sometimes hard to unearth. Samsung gave the GS5 what may be the fastest autofocus in mobile at 0.3 seconds. However, you often won't be able to take advantage of it. If the light isn't great, and you don't tap to focus, the phone takes several seconds to actually take the photo, negating the autofocus advantage.

The camera UI has several irritations, as well. For starters, it takes awhile to launch the camera from the lock screen. Then, when you turn the phone to the left to take the shot (which I believe is the norm), the volume buttons, which serve as the physical shutter, are on the bottom. Finally, the UI doesn't respond in a way where it's clear you actually took the photo, an annoyance of many Android cameras.

Credit: Mashable, Will Fenstermaker

If you like photos with bokeh -- where your subject is in focus while the background is blurred to the extreme -- you're in luck. The Galaxy S5 can simulate the effect with a software trick. After using it, however, I found the results lacking. The HTC One M8, with its Duo Camera, does a much better job creating bokeh, although the pics are lower resolution. Also, because the HTC creates the effect with a depth sensor, it's available on every pic; on the S5, you have to choose the feature before you shoot.

For the S5's camera, Samsung pared down the number of Smart modes -- presets for things such as portraits and panoramas -- with more available for download. It's a step in the right direction, but misguided.

The problem wasn't just sheer numbers; it's one of overall approach. If you take one look at the settings screen in the camera, you see it clearly. There are more than 20 adjustments you can make, all democratically laid out in a grid. I expect the usual reaction will be to take one look at it, and vow never to return.

[nggallery id=15859]

One camera feature that's fantastic -- with no qualification -- is the real-time HDR mode. Most smartphone cameras can shoot with HDR (high dynamic range), which snaps multiple shots of the same scene with varying exposure and combines them. However, there's no way to know if HDR will actually improve the photo â€¦ unless you're using the Galaxy S5. With HDR preview engaged, you can see what you're getting before you snap. Much appreciated.

Feature Creep

Samsung thankfully has rolled back its typical bloatware; you won't find apps and widgets for the Samsung hub pre-installed on the Galaxy S5. You will, however, find widgets that serve as gateways to downloading certain Samsung apps, as well as some apps from their partners. And there are still certainly a few pre-loaded apps, the most notable being S Health.

S Health is more than just Samsung's bid to get in on the fitness-tracking movement. I mean, it's definitely that, but it's not a half-assed bid. S Health, which actually debuted in the Galaxy S4, serves as a central hub for fitness data, communicating with any Gear smartwatches you may have. Even if you don't have a wearable, S Health can track your steps via the built-in pedometer. That's 50% of what your Jawbone UP does right there.

Part of S Health is the famed heart-rate monitor. Samsung got lots of attention for being the first to put such a sensor in a smartphone, and it should: The monitor works very well. You need to master the art of pressing firmly yet gently for it to work, but having a spot check of your heartbeat anytime you want is nice to have, even if the number of situations where you'd need it is pretty limited. In any case, now developers are free to think up some more.

Samsung is in love with a feature borrowed from its tablets called My Magazine. It's essentially a clone of HTC's BlinkFeed, which is itself a clone of Flipboard. You swipe to the right from your home screen to see My Magazine, which is basically a scrollable list of visual updates from various sources you specify, mixed with some of your social feeds.

Here, once again, I find the Samsung experience inferior to the HTC's. My Magazine only shows a dozen or so updates before the scroll ends -- a strange limitation given today's ever-scrolling default on most services. More disappointing is that the overall mix between news and social updates just seems a little off. I hardly ever saw anything worth checking out in My Magazine, which is strange because Flipboard actually makes it.

If you've ever had your phone die on you, the Galaxy S5's Ultra Power Saving mode will have you breathing a little easier. When engaged, your phone will only work with calls and text messages, and the screen goes black and white. A few minutes of battery will last for hours when the phone is in Ultra Power Saving mode. It's a great idea -- I just wish Samsung thought to add manually pulled email to the list of communications allowed.

Arguably the best new feature in the Galaxy S5 is the download booster. When it's turned on, the phone is able to use both its Wi-Fi and LTE connections to speed up downloading of large files. That's potentially very useful for transferring, say, video files from a cloud service. Unfortunately, the feature needs to be carrier-enabled, and we weren't able to test it prior to launch. We'll examine the GS5's download booster in a future story.

One thing you'll be reminded of every time you recharge the Galaxy S5 is that it's waterproof. That's because you'll need to pull off the tiny flap over the microUSB port (3.0, by the way) in order to connect the cable. The GS5 is rated to withstand 3 feet of depth for up to 30 minutes. Like the Ultra Power Saving mode, it's not a feature you'll use much, but you'll be glad it's there when you do.

Not the Sum of Its Parts

I was surprised that the Samsung Galaxy S5 disappointed me. I found the Galaxy Note 3 to be an awesome phone, with such a clarity of purpose that its productivity-focused audience of power users couldn't not love it.

But the S5 is a different animal, with a different customer in mind. The mainstream is more fickle, and it cares more about intangibles like ""feel"" and everyday features like the camera. On that score, the Galaxy S5 doesn't fall on its face, but it doesn't excel either.

Let's face it: There are a lot of great Android phones out there. While the GS5 is a well-performing device (and benchmarks(Opens in a new window), courtesy of AnandTech, confirm this), it's hurt by Samsung's jack-of-all-trades, master-of-none approach. Phones such as the Nexus 5 and HTC One win loyalty by excelling at one or two standout features.

The Galaxy S5, on the other hand, tries to power through on sheer quantity of features rather than quality. That may work with the Galaxy S III crowd who are looking to upgrade, anyway. But for the rest of us â€¦ well, you can try again next year, Samsung.

7009327,"Samsung Gear Fit Is Beautiful, Inside and Out","When Samsung announced its ultra-sleek Gear Fit device in February, tech journalists heralded the fitness tracker-smartwatch hybrid as the wearable we've been waiting for -- something that's easy on the eyes in a space filled with clunky products that only sort of hit the mark.

Now that we've spent some time with the Gear Fit, which goes on sale Friday, April 11 for $199, we're pleased to say those expectations line up with the real story.

Unfortunately, the device is only compatible with about 20 Galaxy-branded devices, so you're out of luck for now if you're running iOS or have a non-Samsung smartphone. But for those who fall into that group and are eying a fitness wearable, this is by far your best option yet.

There's no denying that the device is beautiful(Opens in a new window), largely thanks to the 1.85-inch curved Super AMOLED display -- the first time we've seen a curved screen on a wrist wearable. It makes brilliant colors come to life, and sliding your finger over the display feels as smooth as a smartphone's touchscreen. Using the device is seamless and satisfying.

Although the response isn't perfect, the overall experience is light-years ahead of competitors such as the Nike+ Fuelband SE, Fitbit Force and Jawbone UP24, in terms of both performance and aesthetics. In one fell swoop, Samsung has made them obsolete.

[nggallery ID=15785]

The Gear Fit's existence is to encourage you to live an active life -- walk more, exercise often, keep track of food intake, monitor your heart rate -- but Samsung's overall objective here is to introduce many consumers to fitness wearables for the first time ever. You may first come to the device for fitness monitoring, but you'll stay for the features typically found in smartwatches.

This is particularly true when it comes to getting notifications like email and phone call alerts sent directly to your wrist. When it's freezing outside or your hands are full, it's so much easier to tap your wrist than go digging for your smartphone when a text or call comes in.

The Gear Fit doesn't have a camera and it's not running the Tizen mobile operating system like Samsung's Gear smartwatches, but it can handle your sweat from workouts and is hypoallergenic too, meaning it's far less likely to give you a rash like the recently recalled Fitbit band. The Gear Fit excels more in some areas than others, but overall, it's the sexiest wearable on the market and well worth the extra $50 you have to pay over competitors.

Here's a look at the full picture:

The Right Fit

The lightweight device weighs just 0.95 ounce -- less than half the weight of the Samsung Gear 2 smartwatch -- and rests comfortably on the wrists. The rubber wristband is noticeably less flimsy than what's found on the Fitbit Force and softer to the touch than the Nike+ Fuelband and Jawbone UP 24's band.

The biggest design win, though, is the adjustable wristband that lets you select your size by snapping a rubber prong into one of the holes on the strap. Unlike competitors, you can really customize how it feels and not have it sit too tight or too loose. The band can also be removed altogether and replaced with different styles, another plus that many other wearables don't have. Too often, you're stuck with whatever color the company deems is best and there's little room for personalization.

One problem: The display nearly overtakes (and even spills over) tiny wrists. Those with normal to large-sized wrists likely won't have a problem. Overall, the Gear Fit is much nicer to look at than other wearables -- which are often rugged and unattractive -- so this is a good step forward.

One of the major challenges smartwatches and fitness trackers with displays (like the Fitbit Force) face today is comfort related to interacting with the screen. When you tap and use the display, you have to tilt your wrist toward you and the angle is slightly awkward. During testing, the Gear Fit required you to swipe the touchscreen in a horizontal motion. Samsung says it's adding a vertical option this week, so we imagine swiping will only get easier. Motorola's not-yet-released Moto360 smart watch will take on this vertical approach too. To work around the landscape swipe, I found myself wearing the device sot he display was on the bottom of my wrist, because it required less straining.

Getting It Ready

The setup process is relatively painless, but it's also easy to get tripped up along the way. There are two main steps you'll need to take to properly get going. First, users must access the Gear Manager on the smartphone to link the device. After turning on Bluetooth and hitting ""scan"" in the manager to look for the device (the ""scan"" part is easy to miss) it took me a good 10 minutes to figure out why the Gear Fit wasn't automatically locating the hardware. Once you've figured that out, you'll need to download the S Health app, where all of your fitness data will live.

In S Health users must sign up for a Samsung account and type in username, email address (to later send notifications to the Gear Fit) and fill out a personal body profile (age, sex, height, weight and so on).

Taking It for a Ride

Now on to the fun stuff. To turn on or wake up the touchscreen on the device, users must hit a small button that sits on top of the display. Because we're so accustomed to accessing touchscreens these days, you'll likely go right for the interface instead of the button and it might take you a few tries to get used to doing so. I assume Samsung added the button because it didn't want you to accidentally turn on the device every time you tapped. That would quickly get annoying, especially as you sleep.

Because the built-in gyroscope senses your motion, the Gear Fit is programmed to automatically light up every time when you move your wrist. Every time. I first noticed this while out to dinner and was repeatedly disrupted and distracted by my glowing wrist. It's possible to turn the setting off from the Fit itself -- something I imagine almost everyone will want to do (it's unclear why Samsung doesn't make this an opt in feature instead of an opt out) -- but finding that function on the device itself isn't entirely intuitive.

The software baked into the device itself is easy enough to navigate, but there are certainly things Samsung could do to make it simpler. For example, the UI uses checkmarks as prompts to move you along to the next screen, except sometimes they're arrows. The placement of the checkmark varies depending on the feature, too. Consistency here would cut down on moving along to the wrong screens.

There's a lot you can do directly from the display without heading over to the S Health app, like using the ""Find My Device"" feature. Instead of looking all around the house or office for your smartphone, the feature lets you locate your phone instantly via a wailing noise. Although this is hardly a new feature for smartphones, it's cool that you don't need to log into yet another device to use it.

Personalization plays a big role in the device's software too. You can pick different wallpapers to serve as the device's backdrop, customize the clock design and of course, get a deeper look at your heart rate and fitness levels with the accompanying S Health app. You can also control the music playing on your phone via the wristband tracker, which is especially great for working out or commuting to work.

Although battery life is pretty strong -- it went a few days without needing a refresh -- a major downside is that you have to charge the device by snapping on a small accessory and then hooking it into the charging wire. That means there are two things you need to carry around with you.

Credit: Christina Ascani

During the course of our testing, we actually misplaced the accessory and were out of luck. Fortunately, Samsung will sell the accessories separately, but that's the last thing you want to worry about when adding a new device to your gadget repertoire. When traveling or running out the door, you might remember to grab your smartphone charger but easily overlook a charging accessory like this. Samsung does this to keep the Gear Fit small, but we hope future iterations will include a microUSB charging port directly within the device.

S Health App

Credit: Christina Ascani

There's a lot you can do directly from the Fit itself, but the meat of the experience lies within the S Health app. It lets you set fitness goals, monitor your tracking and (eventually) stay on top of your sleep cycle (this feature wasn't available during the test period). The Health S app is also available for download without the Gear Fit device, but using the two together makes the most out of the experience.

One of the neatest features of the Gear Fit is the built-in heart-rate monitor. While it sits on your wrist, a sensor opposite the device's face collects your heart-rate data and stores it within the app. You can also check your heart rate directly via the hardware itself, which makes it easy to monitor while out for a run or doing other activities. Getting this feature to work may take a few shots, though -- you'll have to stand still and make sure the sensor is directly over your wrist.

The device itself lets you call out different workout activities -- running, cycling, walking and hiking -- and keeps all of that data in one spot, tracking your progression. It's important to note, however, there were instances where the data didn't log correctly and thought I was walking when I was just moving my hands.

Notifications

The notifications feature on the Gear Fit is where Samsung hopes to close the gap between fitness wristband tracker and smartwatch -- and it's in a great position to do so. Although you can't take calls, you can see on your wrist when they pop up and send them directly to voicemail or respond with a quick reply. Quick reply messages -- such as ""I'm driving"" and ""call back later"" -- are pre-written, but can be personalized up to 160 characters via the app.

Users can also read full emails on the device, which may sound unpleasant given the Gear Fit's small surface area, but it's easy to use your finger to scroll down on the touchscreen and see a sentence or two at a time. Unfortunately, you can't flag emails from your wrist to serve as a reminder to go back and respond later.

Notifications work well when a Samsung device is nearby, but if you're out for a walk and leave the smartphone at home, your Gear Fit suddenly becomes much less powerful. You'll still be able to use some of the device's core features such as the pedometer and heart-rate monitor, but you won't be able to receive call and email alerts.

Overall, the Samsung Gear Fit is our best hope for wearables to date. It's aesthetically stunning, easy to use and is the best fitness tracker on the market. And with a sprinkling of smartwatch capabilities, it truly offers the best of both worlds.

Last year, Borschberg and Piccard alternated flying a different solar-powered plane, called Solar Impulse, from California to New York, completing the cross-country journey on July 6, 2013, after roughly two months and five planned stops. The pilots are planning to fly the new Solar Impulse 2 plane on a first-of-its-kind journey around the world.

Super Smash Bros. director Masahiro Sakurai announced the news during Nintendo's 35-minute streaming presentation Tuesday night. Sakurai highlighted the differences between the two platform's versions, and unveiled new features and characters.

Both versions of Super Smash Bros. will feature online play. Users can play with their friends through Miiverse, Nintendo's social network, or via random online matches. The online matches are broken down into two types: ""for fun"" in which the stage selection is random and items have been turned on, and ""for glory"" in which items are turned off, the only stage is the featureless ""Final Destination"" and all stats are recorded.

Nintendo will focus more heavily on an online code of conduct for matches, where players can be banned for abandoning matches, self-destructing, bullying other players, cheating and other unsportsmanlike conduct. All online matches will also be tied to a player's Nintendo network ID, a recently implemented identity across the Wii U and 3DS. There will also be online matchmaking based on skill level.

Sakurai revealed new characters in Super Smash Bros., as well. Previously, Samus(Opens in a new window), the heroine in action-adventure game Metroid, would transform into Zero Suit Samus(Opens in a new window) at certain points in the match; now Zero Suit Samus has become a standalone character with more powerful rocket boots. The same was done for Princess Zelda's transformation into Sheik; the two are now separate characters. Pokemon Charizard is coming back as a character, instead of being attached to the Pokemon Trainer character, and Pokemon X and Y starter Greninja is joining the fray.

The 3DS version of Super Smash Bros. also includes a mode called ""Smash Run,"" where up to four players spend five minutes running through a dungeon to beat up enemies, and grab power-ups. Those power ups act as temporary ability modifiers that remain in effect for the next portion of ""Smash Run,"" when the players compete against each other in a fight.

""In 2014,"" he added, ""we're focused on building a Twitter that is truly accessible and valuable to everyone."" What better way to do that than by borrowing some of the look and feel from the social network that's come closest to that goal: Facebook.

Twitter unveiled a new design for profile pages on Tuesday with more prominent lead images and the option to choose a top tweet to display. As many, many users quickly pointed out, the design makes Twitter look that much more similar to Facebook. That might not be such a bad thing.

""If today's announcement makes the service more accessible for more people, then that's great news for Twitter,"" says Nate Elliott, an analyst with Forrester Research.

Twitter had 241 million monthly users at the end of the December quarter, less than a fifth of Facebook's user base, and its pace of user growth has slowed. That set off an alarm among investors. (Perhaps more troubling, third-party data(Opens in a new window) suggest that millions of users have signed up for Twitter accounts only to stop using the service later).

""Twitter has to reignite growth,"" says Brian Blau, an analyst with Gartner. ""They've got to take these bold steps now.""

Just in the six months since Twitter's high-profile IPO, the company has redesigned the desktop home page and profile pages, overhauled discovery features in the app to emphasize elements like conversations around television and it has introduced the option to upload more photos per tweet and tag users in them (a popular Facebook feature).

By making Twitter a little more like other popular social networks, the company may reduce the learning curve for users as well as for marketers and be able to piggyback on some of the success that its competitors have had. Case in point: Twitter has broadened its ad retargeting program, similar to Facebook. It is also reportedly(Opens in a new window) planning to roll out 15 new ad products over the next six months, including app-install ads, a format that has reaped dividends for Facebook.

7009042,Twitter Rolls Out Its Facebook-Like Profile Redesign,"Twitter is gradually rolling out a major redesign of user profiles, starting on Tuesday. The new look, which Twitter was testing in February, adds a lot more user information and several new features -- and it looks quite similar to Facebook's user profiles.

The new profile features a larger user photo and customizable header image. Twitter highlights your tweets that have the most engagement by displaying them slightly larger than the rest. You can also pin one of your tweets to the top of the page.

Furthermore, you can now choose which timeline to view when checking out a profile page. You can see all tweets, tweets with photos and videos only, or just tweets and replies.

As for the similarities of Twitter's new user profiles to Facebook's profile page, well, they're inescapable. There's a square profile photo in the top left, and a large ""cover"" photo on top dominates both pages, for example. Below the profile photo you'll find the basic info about the user, and under that is photos and friends. The only real difference there is that on Twitter's user profiles, photos are placed below your followers, and Facebook has it the other way around. It'll be interesting to see what the users think of the new look -- especially those that are not overly fond of Facebook.

7009134,Twitter Users Have a Lot to Say About the Redesign (Shocker.),"Your Twitter profile page is about to look a lot like Facebook, and chances are, you have a pretty strong opinion about it.

Nearly two months after the company quietly tested a new layout among a small group of users, news first reported by Mashable, Twitter is officially rolling out a new design starting on Tuesday. Social media users are notoriously adverse to change, with the slightest update often awakening the most critical of members, so it's not surprising the news brought a bevy of negative reactions, mostly with users calling it out as too similar to Facebook.

Among the major changes is that the user's main picture and bio are now scaled to the left, and there is significantly more real estate dedicated to the header photo. The revamped timeline makes tweets look larger and there is greater focus on photos. Although the original test had ""tiles"" or ""cards"" that moved away from a vertical timeline, this design reinstates what we're used to seeing.

In addition, tweets with more engagement appear larger in user timelines, and you can filter based on photos/videos, replies and so on. It's also possible to ""pin"" tweets to the top of your profile page, calling out specific content you want followers to notice.

Here's a look at the general (and mixed) reaction bubbling up on, of course, Twitter:

7009205,Twitter's New Profiles: Everything You Need to Know,"The rumors and feature teases are true: New Twitter profiles are here, with a brand-new, yet oddly familiar, look. As of April 22, anyone can switch to the new design(Opens in a new window). And it may represent a real turning point.

Like many people who live on Twitter, I don't look at my own profile page very often. I spend most of my time on the Twitter.com homepage to see tweets from all the accounts I follow, and my Notifications page to track replies and mentions of my handle. I last managed my Twitter profile ages ago.

SEE ALSO: 10 Historic Tweets That Captivated the World

However, I look at other users' profile pages fairly often. It's where I learn about who they are through their profile picture and their brief description of themselves, which may include details like job, location and a link for more information. In other words, profile pages are important, especially for brands, celebrities and new users.

To understand how these new profiles are built and what they mean for your Twitter experience, we created a new Twitter account. This is your walk-through.

The changes

An old profile next to a new profile Credit: Screenshot

Yes, the new Twitter profile does look somewhat like Facebook's profile page layout, but the overarching theme here appears to be ""big."" All the elements on the page are big, from the Twitter profile picture to the full-width header image -- and, of course, tweets. They get larger depending on their popularity. For new accounts, though, everything is big, since all your tweets are equally popular (or unpopular) since you have no followers or retweets in the beginning. Despite this apparent pituitary issue, the rapid growth of all these elements actually adds more white space to the design, making the profile page, perhaps, somewhat less text-heavy and overwhelming for new users.

Getting started

Step 1 and 2 on building your new Twitter Profile Credit: Screenshots

There's nothing remarkable about the initial setup of the new Twitter. Once you have your user name (good luck finding one that isn't already taken), Twitter walks you through the process of building your timeline. Profile building is saved for the end. In the two screens above, Twitter is, on the left, offering me a list of recommended Twitter profiles to follow. The screen on the right serves up notables grouped by categories like Music and Sports. This is where you find your celebrities, some of whom already have the new profile(Opens in a new window). The next screen, not shown here, encourages you to add people from your email contacts.

Building the new you

It's time to add your avatar. Credit:

The first step in building your new Twitter profile screen is really this one. It's where you add the profile picture and description of yourself. A couple of interesting notes about this screen: You can, as before, skip it and leave your photo and description blank. In the old Twitter profile, blank profile pics were represented as eggs -- a nod to, I guess, your unhatched Twitter bird. Notice that the default avatar is now a silhouette and actually looks remarkably like Facebook's no-photo avatar.

Considering how different the new profile pages are, I'm surprised Twitter isn't offering more guidance on image size, shape, etc. The actual profile pic is much larger than this preview and also in a different spot. My guess is that Twitter has yet to update the account set-up process.

Almost there

This is where you add your profile background. Credit: Screenshot

The next screen introduces you to the new Twitter profile page. As you can see, the profile pic is much larger than in current profiles. To complete the profile look, though, you need to add a header image. This is not the same as the background or theme for your entire account. Twitter still offers a collection of preset themes and the ability to upload your own. I suspect, though, that backgrounds built for the old profiles may not work with this new design.

To add a profile header image (which will take up that blue space behind your profile picture -- just like on Facebook and Google+), you click on the space and upload a photo (1,500 pixels wide, max). Twitter lets you scale and move it around to position it properly. While many Twitter users build their existing profile pics and backgrounds to work together creatively, they'll have to redo them for the new profiles because the positioning is different.

At this point, you can see a lot of big changes. Twitter names, handles, descriptions, links and the pic are all on the far left (like Facebook). However, they still stand out because there's nothing below them. The menu of Tweets, Following, Followers, Favorites and Lists are all gone. As soon as you post a photo or video, that little checkerboard square of media elements will reappear below your profile picture and description.

If you're visiting someone else's new Twitter profile page, you'll see the familiar ""Tweet to"" box for that account.

""Who to Follow"" and ""Trends"" have moved to the lower right. I wish Twitter would reverse those two boxes. Trends are far more important than following new people. As it is, I worry that, in their new position, those two boxes will be missed altogether.

Both good and bad

Twitter has a whole new look for the Follower list. Credit:

Twitter's ""Following"" list is almost unrecognizable. Instead of an actual list, we get a Pinterest-like board of cards for everyone you're following. This allows Twitter to add more detail to each account listing (profile pic, header image, description, ""Follow"" link and an ""Other actions"" menu). Personally, I prefer the simple list.

This is the new Twitter Profile Edit screen. Credit: Screenshot

Twitter's ""Edit Profile"" screen is also completely new and much, much improved from previous versions. I defy anyone to get confused here.

Self-promotion

This is how you pin a Tweet Credit: Composite

One of the new Twitter profile's most exciting features is the ability to pin a tweet. Now you can click on the little More menu in every tweet (those three dots), and select ""Pin to your profile page"" (see the image on the above left). Now everyone will see that tweet first (above right). It's a smart move by Twitter, but adding some scheduling capabilities might be wise, since I bet people will forget that they've pinned old Tweets to the top of their page.

The big picture

The New Twitter Profile Credit: Screenshot

Overall, Twitter's new profile pages are better-looking than their predecessors, but the reliance on large pictures and really large fonts is a bit overwhelming. ""Big"" doesn't necessarily mean ""inviting."" I think Twitter's efforts to make the service more accessible to everyone are laudable, but this new look may turn off some Twitter pros who prefer their social media lean and mean. On the other hand, most expert users live not only outside Twitter profiles, but off of Twitter.com entirely. They spend their Twitter days on services like Twitter's own TweetDeck and third-party options like Hootsuite and SocialFlow.",4/8/2014 0:00,0.535613,5,1,1,4.685552,6,00000,1880.118,3573.4,2442.945,4100,0.467244,0.131088,0.042493,0.011331,0.5,0.416667,462

Er, scratch that -- UConn won the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) championship with its 60-54 victory over Kentucky.

[seealso url = ""http://mashable.com/2014/04/04/tbt-the-basketball-tournament""]

Fox News anchor Heather Childers, however, congratulated the Huskies for winning the NAACP championship in a Tuesday morning episode of Fox & Friends First (see video above).

Childers got the acronym right on a second pass and, on Twitter, she insisted the mix-up was a simple slip of the tongue.

Thanks @Dave4Golf(Opens in a new window)! I immediately corrected myself. Anyone who follows me knows I love sports. Just misspoke. Fuel 4 late night comics ;)â€” Heather Childers (@HeatherChilders) April 8, 2014(Opens in a new window)

The two acronyms aren't that far off, if you squint your eyes, and it's not all that hard to imagine a cable news host juggling 10 different trains of thought to make such a mistake.

But given Fox News' rather, ah, right-of-center stance on social issues -- and the fact that 11 of the 15 players on UConn's roster(Opens in a new window) are African American -- the verbal stumble sounded more like a Freudian slip to many.

This story gets better, too. As Mother Jones(Opens in a new window) points out, Saturday Night Live came freakishly close to predicting Childer's gaffe in its most recent episode.

""It's tough to sign up for things, I've tried for years to join the NAACP,"" actor Bobby Moynihan says while portraying a Fox & Friends host.

7009198,Holy Huskies! UConn Takes 2014 NCAA Men's Basketball Title,"Kid Rock got things off to an awkward start with his pre-game concert, but Shabazz Napier, Ryan Boatright and the Connecticut Huskies put on a proper show once the ball was tipped in Monday night's NCAA men's basketball championship game.

Napier, the feisty senior guard who won a title as a freshman three years ago behind the heroics of then-senior Kemba Walker, finished his own magical March Madness run in style, totaling 22 points and six rebounds while playing 39 of a possible 40 minutes in a 60-54 win over Kentucky.

[seealso url = ""http://mashable.com/2014/04/07/kentucky-uconn-perfect-march-madness-finale""]

Junior guard Boatright, who shares Napier's lack of height and abundance of quickness, played a stellar supporting role with 14 points, three assists and three rebounds of his own. Together, they helped Huskies coach Kevin Ollie earn his first championship in his first year of eligibility (UConn was banned from March Madness last year, Ollie's first season as head coach, for past violations).

UConn was seeded seventh to start the tournament, then went on an upset run that began in the second round against two-seed Villanova, and continued through a Final Four win over one-seed Florida to set up Monday's matchup against Kentucky.

Ollie's Huskies got the historic win, but it was Kentucky's James Young -- while leading the Wildcats' losing cause with 20 points -- who won Twitter with this absolutely incredible second-half dunk:

After the final buzzer, Napier fell to his knees on the court of AT&T Stadium -- where an NCAA-record 79,238 people were in attendance -- while crying tears of joy.

But what's a major American sporting event without a little post-game interview drama? Much like Richard Sherman after this year's Super Bowl, Napier used his post-game moment to lash out at the NCAA for banning UConn last season because of poor overall academic performance under Ollie's predecessor, legendary coach Jim Calhoun.

â€œLadies and gentlemen, youâ€™re looking at the hungry Huskies, this is what happens when you ban us, last year, two years, we worked so hard for it, two years ...â€ Napier said(Opens in a new window) before CBS cameras cut away.

Earlier Monday, a tweet purporting to show a notice posted by a stodgy UConn dormitory residential advisor went quasi-viral in online sports circles.

7029036,U.S. Navy's New Weapon Fires at 7 Times the Speed of Sound,"The U.S. Navy's latest innovation comes in the form of a 23-pound projectile that can fly at seven times the speed of sound, and it will be ready for testing at sea by 2016.

That's fast enough(Opens in a new window) to travel from New York City's Empire State Building to Philadelphia's Liberty Bell in 180 seconds. The projectile can punch through three walls of reinforced concrete and annihilate just about anything it smashes into. It moves so quickly, in fact, that it doesn't require a triggered explosion on impact; its sheer force is enough to destroy its targets.

Chris Johnson, a spokesperson for Naval Sea Systems Command, told Mashable these recently revealed projectiles will hopefully be able to hit incoming missiles, overhead planes, other sea vessels and targets on land. The small projectiles come equipped with a navigation system that will let them hone in on incoming rockets and vanquish them before any damage is done.

The projectile's power comes from a rail gun, a Star Wars-like(Opens in a new window) weapon which use electricity to launch projectiles down a pair of tracks. Think of how a train starts moving: Once the projectile gets going at mach seven, it packs a punch equivalent to â€œa freight train going through the wall at a hundred miles an hour,"" Chief of Naval Research Rear Adm. Matthew Klunder told Breaking Defense(Opens in a new window).

The projectiles can only travel about 100 miles(Opens in a new window), which is enough to keep ships out of range of most rockets fired from land, even if it's not close to the 1,500 land miles(Opens in a new window) that the Navy's standard cruise missiles can fly for.

That matters less when price comes into play. At $25,000, these tiny projectiles cost about 1% of what the price of a conventional Navy missile. Those numbers are even more eye-catching, given that the Department of Defense's budget is shrinking.

The Navy hopes to load a rail gun onto a ship for the first on-the-water test shots by 2016, according to Johnson. Rapid-fire trials won't happen until 2018, and no date is set for actually installing a rail gun on a ship. After 2018, the Navy will come up with a timeline for designing a ship with the weapon built in.

While that unfolds, naval researchers will also be developing a 2.0 version(Opens in a new window) of the rail gun. The hope is that this one will be better suited for rapid fire and also able to withstand the intense heat that comes from launching successive rounds.",4/8/2014 0:00,0.532353,2,1,0,4.404011,6,Business,0,7278.85,3017.299,11900,0.506117,0.135427,0.048711,0.020057,0.05,0.05,1500
6885902,Chief of USAID Doesn't Know Who Created 'Cuban Twitter',"The chief of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) said he's unsure who had the idea to create a Twitter-like social network in Cuba, a project his own agency funded.

In a heated exchange, Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) pressed Rajiv Shah, the administrator of USAID, to tell him who was behind USAID's effort to fund and create ZunZuneo, a stripped-down social network marketed to Cubans that had the ultimate goal of stirring unrest in the Island.

Leahy called the project a ""cockamamie idea"" and repeatedly asked Shah to explain whose idea it was to launch the project.

Shah dodged the question several times, saying the program was designed in 2007 and 2008, before he became the USAID administrator. He added the original story, which was published by the Associated Press(Opens in a new window), had a number of inaccuracies.

Finally, Leahy interrupted Shah and asked him once more: ""Do you know whose idea it was?""

""I do not specifically,"" Shah responded, before explaining that ""working on creating platforms to improve communication in Cuba and in many other parts of the world is a core part of what USAID has done for some time and continues to do.""

The AP broke the story about ZunZuneo last week, and since then, both the White House and USAID claimed the program was not ""covert"" or ""illegal,"" as the original story implied. On Monday, USAID posted a vehement denial listing eight facts that the original report allegedly got wrong.

During the hearing, Shah echoed the main point in the USAID's denial, that the program was not ""covert"" at all, but it was ""discreet"" due to the sensitivity of the project. However, it remains unclear how aware the White House was of the program, and who exactly authorized it.",4/8/2014 0:00,0.539432,9,1,0,4.920245,6,Business,1050.5,4787.262,3124.2,1700,0.413636,0.116142,0.03681,0.021472,0,0,758

After meeting with a group of foreign ministers from the Union of South American States (Unasur), Maduro said he is ready to offer a ""very positive message of peace,"" according to the BBC(Opens in a new window). However, opposition parties say they will only come to the table if Maduro meets certain conditions.

""They proposed a meeting with the delegation from the opposition for tomorrow, and I accepted,"" Maduro said on state television, according to Bloomberg(Opens in a new window). ""Iâ€™ll be ready, Iâ€™ll be there where Unasur tells me to be.""

But the umbrella opposition group, Table for Democratic Unity (MUD), said it was ""willing to hold a true dialogue, with a clear agenda, equal conditions [for both sides] and the first meeting of which will be transmitted live on national radio and television channels.""

It's still unclear whether Maduro will agree to these conditions. The government and the opposition have not yet met after the beginning of the protests. But this could be a sign that the two parties are willing to move toward a diplomatic solution to end the country-wide protests that have resulted in 39 deaths over the past two months.

Part of the opposition, however, may not be happy about these talks because they're brokered by Unasur, an association that is seen as an ally of the government and the ""Chavismo,"" according to the Spanish daily El Pais(Opens in a new window).

In fact, Luis Florido, a member of the party founded by jailed opposition leader Leopoldo Lopez, said the government will need to do a ""clear gesture"" before any peace talks begin.

If Vox were looking for a model to emulate, it could have done worse.

Former Washington Post star Ezra Klein's explanatory journalism website launched Sunday night and serves as the namesake for Vox Media, which also publishes The Verge, Eater and SB Nation. The site's content has quickly been likened to a newsier Wikipedia, with navigation that can be clicked through to gain an understanding about news and current events.

yeah i can't think of how detailed, updated backgrounders on complex news stories written by expert reporters would be at all useful

â€” Matthew Zeitlin (@MattZeitlin) April 7, 2014(Opens in a new window)

The site's welcome post(Opens in a new window), penned by Klein, fellow former Washington Post journalist Melissa Bell and former Slate writer Matt Yglesias, highlights that the site is meant to serve as a source for information, with an ultimate goal of providing context to the news.

The site's launch is ""the beginning of our effort to build the vast repository of information that will make it possible for us to explain the news in real time,"" according to the post.

Comparisons to Wikipedia's content might be a bit overly simplistic, but are flattering when it comes to SEO and web traffic.

The Wikimedia Foundation, which owns Wikipedia and several other sites, now attracts roughly 500 million visitors per month(Opens in a new window) with billions of page views. Google's search alone generates 56% of that traffic, according to comScore.

Media websites are particularly beholden two areas of the Internet: social media and search. Wikipedia may have cornered the market on search, but BuzzFeed has found success corralling traffic from social media. BuzzFeed generates about 75% of its traffic through social referrals, according to Reuters(Opens in a new window). Vox sports the now-standard social media share buttons, but the evergreen nature of its content is more suited to long tail searches.

Vox would not be the first site to attempt to corner the market on search engine trends. An exhaustive article(Opens in a new window) in SF Weekly detailed how Bleacher Report, a popular sports website, generated great traffic by determining people's search habits in order to optimize its content accordingly.

Some companies have even tried to game the system. Rap Genius ended up in hot water with Google for some questionable linking practices.

Those cards

The singular innovation of Vox, at least for now, is its cards.

Theyâ€™re inspired by the highlighters and index cards that some of us used in school to remember important information. Youâ€™ll find them attached to articles, where they add crucial context; behind highlighted words(Opens in a new window), where they allow us to offer deeper explanations of key concepts; and in their stacks(Opens in a new window), where they combine into detailed â€” and continuously updated â€” guides to ongoing news stories.

A recent New York Times(Opens in a new window) article lauded Vox's intersection of journalism and technology as an important element of its efforts. Highlighters and index cards may not sound like the most technologically advanced idea, but permanent pages -- the cards -- that are routinely updated will provide an important foothold for the site.

As Bell told the Times, each card will be ""like a wiki page written by one person with a little attitude.""

Obamacare and the missing Malaysian airliner are two of the topics covered by the site's inaugural series of cards. A quick Google Trends inquiry highlights just how popular these topics have become on its search engine.

The searches for Obamacare:

The searches for MH370:

It will take time to rise through the ranks of search engines, but the permanence of the cards is an important advantage.

Links are an important part of search engines. As Vox builds up its archives and link to its cards (and hopes that others do as well), those pages will rise up the search rankings.

It will be difficult to corner the market on an established topic like Obamacare, which has already generated thousands of articles. Newer stories may prove easier. If Vox's card on the Malaysian airliner had existed since the plane first went missing a month ago, it could have already been referenced many times and risen up the ranks.

The upside of turning up high on a search ranking for a key term like Obamacare is a flood of traffic. The downside is that SEO has become a very competitive field in which the winners take the bulk of the traffic. Those who can't make it to the first page of search results see rapidly diminished returns. The first result in a search engine gets 33% of the traffic(Opens in a new window), and the drop-off after that is steep.

Moving targets

""Weâ€™ll always be a work in progress,"" Vox concludes in its welcome post. For a site that seems reliant on traffic driven by people searching for a wide range of information, it will need to live up to that adage.

Search is not a stagnant element, and not even Wikipedia is immune to the ever-changing nature of the Internet. The site endured a traffic dip in 2013(Opens in a new window) as Google's Knowledge Graph started to infringe on its turf.

For Vox's search engine play to succeed, it will need to maintain a certain malleability. Google, not to mention other search engines, changes its search algorithm almost daily(Opens in a new window).

This leaves businesses that rely on Google in a precarious position, digital media entrepreneur Jason Calacanis noted at a recent tech conference: â€œIf [Google is] taking the traffic away from Wikipedia, which is a non-profit, how do you think theyâ€™re gonna treat everyone else?â€",4/8/2014 0:00,0,0,10,0,0,10,00000,0,6317.7,2865.025,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9300
7009178,Wattpad Raises $46 Million to Build a Global Literary Community,"Could the next billion-user Internet company be one that focuses on literature? It might sound unlikely, but that's Wattpad's goal.

Wattpad(Opens in a new window), an online community for writers and readers to share and discover good stories, announced Tuesday that it has raised $46 million in a Series C round of funding led by OMERS ventures. The latest funding round brings the company's total funding to more than $60 million and is intended to help Wattpad accelerate product and user growth.

""We have a very ambitious goal that eventually this company can have a billion users,"" Allen Lau, cofounder and CEO of Wattpad, told Mashable in a recent interview. ""That's exactly why we are raising this round of money: to go even faster to our vision.""

Wattpad currently has about 25 million registered users, according to Lau, up from about 15 million this time last year. That's impressive for a reading-focused service but still far from that billion-user target. ""It's a very lofty goal,"" Lau admits, noting that it probably won't happen ""this year, or the year after or even in three or four years.""

Users spend a total of nearly 6 billion minutes on the service every month and read the equivalent of 10 hours every minute. About 50% of the activity on the service is from the U.S. The rest is international.

The Toronto-based company raised a $17 million round of funding less than two years ago and still has a ""good portion of the cash in the bank,"" said Lau. It received strong interest from investors and opted to seize the opportunity. With the additional funds, Wattpad will add to its staff of 70 by hiring for product development and community management positions.

""Our user base is growing really fast right now so we have to put a lot of effort in them,"" Lau says. ""We want to hire more talent and grow the company.""",4/8/2014 0:00,0.669565,9,1,0,4.687764,6,Social Media,2544.407,3953.93,3349.987,0,0.459711,0.055104,0.042194,0.025316,0.6,-0.13333,2000

The channel had been demanding a $0.01 increase in its per-subscriber payment from DirecTV. It settled for less than that, according to The Wall Street Journal(Opens in a new window).

The Weather Channel reportedly commands about $0.13 per subscriber, far less than $5.54 by ESPN or $0.60 by CNN, according to estimates from SNL Kagan(Opens in a new window).

Jim Cantore, a meteorologist for the channel, issued a letter(Opens in a new window) directed at DirecTV and said the dispute put people in danger.

The Weather Channel issued a public apology to DirecTV in a press release(Opens in a new window) announcing the new deal.

â€œOur apologies to DirecTV and their customers for the disruption of our service and for initiating a public campaign,â€ said David Kenny, CEO of the Weather Company, parent to The Weather Channel, in the press release. â€œOur viewers deserve better than a public dispute and we pledge to reward their loyalty with exceptional programming and more weather focused news.â€

The dispute highlights the still lucrative place of television despite the rapid growth of online weather services and apps.

6423403,Windows XP: Buried But Terrifyingly Undead,"Microsoft stopped selling Windows XP in 2008(Opens in a new window) and, as of Tuesday, finally stopped supporting the 13-year-old operating system. Itâ€™s gone, buried, but most certainly not dead. And that means weâ€™re about to enter a very, very scary place.

In case youâ€™re wondering, Windows XP will not, at midnight tonight, stop working. The incredibly popular OS will still do everything it did yesterday and just as well. However, there will never be another security update for Windows XP. And while the free Microsoft Security Essentials will still function, eventually those malware signature updates will run out, too.

[seealso slug=""windows-xp-upgrade-or-switch""]

Those of you running Windows 7 or 8 are reading this wondering, â€œSo what? Who cares?â€ Here's why you should.

As late as June 2013, Windows XP still held onto more than 30%(Opens in a new window) of the worldâ€™s computers. Itâ€™s on 95% of American ATMs(Opens in a new window).

Thatâ€™s right, most of the places where you get your money are teetering on the edge of a security cliff. There is a bit of hope here; some percentage of U.S. ATMs are running Windows XP embedded, which still has a few years of support left, but even if just 40 to 50% are running pure Windows XP, there's trouble ahead.

A breach in the digital hull

Isnâ€™t the Internet a grand thing? Our global village is in constant communication and contact with everyone else. We can share 24/7. It makes the world feel smaller, warmer -- and infinitely more dangerous. Thanks to those always-open pipes, your pristine connection to the Internet has a chance of being compromised because someone else isnâ€™t being careful.

Windows XP systems will not be banished from the global village because theyâ€™re out of date. For now, thatâ€™s not a problem, but soon the Internet will feel like a crowded theater where one third of the patrons are carrying a highly infectious disease.

Come to think of it, it already feels that way.

Have you considered how many people you email each day are running antiquated operating systems? Remember all those netbooks companies sold in 2010(Opens in a new window)? They were so successful that it prompted Microsoft to finally block OEMs from being able to bundle Windows XP with new systems (retail availability ended years before). A good number of those netbooks are still running. They really canâ€™t handle much more than Windows XP (though Microsoft has long insisted they can run Windows 7(Opens in a new window)) and the bargain hunters who bought these tiny, lightweight systems arenâ€™t likely to shell out the necessary $70 bucks to upgrade anyway.

Do not assume, by the way, that everyone running Windows XP is a tech neophyte or luddite. A quick glance at Mashableâ€™s digitally-savvy audience shows that 4% are still running Windows XP. Not a huge number, but 4% too many by my count.

Big business problems

The fact that ATMs are still running Windows XP is terrifying, but itâ€™s only the most highly-publicized instance of XPâ€™s incredible tenacity. How many auto mechnaics, dry cleaners, diners, doctor and dentist offices, and sub-50-employee small businesses have you walked into that are still running Windows XP?

More than youâ€™d want to admit, Iâ€™m sure.

They all have their reasons for not switching. Windows XP just works. The interim operating system, Windows Vista was considered by some an unmitigated disaster(Opens in a new window) and worth avoiding. By the time Windows 7 came along, there were just too many Windows XP systems in house and too much corporate knowledge baked into the OS and the often vertical software that runs on it to switch.

Plus, no one wanted to fix what wasnâ€™t broken. Perhaps Microsoft should have sent out some kind of digital dirty bomb that sabotaged all those XP systems. Not something that worked instantly, mind you, but a bug that slowly, but surely made it impossible to keep using the OS.

In a way, thatâ€™s what Microsoft is doing now. Without support and protection, the Windows XP systems will face a relentless stream of cyberattacks that will eventually make all of them unusable, but not before it makes them all vulnerable to attack and breach and doubly dangerous to Internet citizens.

Which is why I am so scared.

This devolution of the Windows XP ecosystem will be a slow-motion fail with potentially catastrophic results. System infections will happen in homes, businesses and ATMs at an unprecedented pace. Even as the world of Windows XP users and customers shrinks, the threat will grow. Many people may point the finger of blame at Microsoft.

And when that happens, as I am certain it will, what will Microsoft do? Will it backtrack? Will it make deals with individual countries(Opens in a new window), states, businesses and school districts to continue offering some kind of support and updates for Windows XP? Or will it hold firm and try to ride out the storm?

I suspect mostly the latter, but the company could end up coming out the other side bloodied and bruised. Will those recalcitrant Windows XP users upgrade, forgive and move on? Will they switch platforms? Maybe theyâ€™ll drop desktops and laptops altogether and help accelerate the shift to a Post-PC world.

Wouldnâ€™t that be an ironic legacy for Windows XP.",4/8/2014 0:00,0.410202,15,12,0,5.022822,10,Entertainment,1051.889,5881.75,3655.622,1800,0.470682,0.333341,0.063278,0.006224,0,0,729
7009112,Windows XP Isn't Safe to Use Anymore. Here's What to Do Next.,"After almost 13 years, Microsoft is ending support for Windows XP. That means that unless you are a major government, no further security updates or patches will be available for the operating system.

Despite Microsoft's best efforts to convince everyone to upgrade to a newer version of Windows, Windows XP is still running on nearly 28%(Opens in a new window) of all computers connected to the Internet. That's a lot of computers -- and users. So what can those users do now?

We've created a checklist:

Download the latest (and final) XP Update

The final ""patch Tuesday"" (Microsoft's term for security updates) for Windows XP was issued on April 8, 2014. Download the latest security updates. This is the last update Microsoft will issue.

Some major governments (including U.S. federal agencies) will continue to use XP -- and UK and Dutch governments are even paying Microsoft(Opens in a new window) to continue support, but everyone else is out of luck.

So download that final update. Now.

Install and update your anti-virus and anti-malware tools

With 30% market share, Microsoft knows it can't just cut support completely. The company has agreed to provide anti-malware updates to Microsoft Security Essentials(Opens in a new window) for Windows XP until 2015.

Microsoft Security Essentials is free, but other security options are available -- including suites from Kaspersky and others. One note: if you've got an old version of Norton or McAfee from 2003 that came bundled with your aging laptop, uninstall it and install Microsoft Security Essentials (or pay for Kaspersky). An out-of-date security app is basically like not having any security at all.

Use Firefox or Chrome

If you have to continue using Windows XP, make sure your web browser is at least being updated. Your web browser is often the place where most users wind up getting infected with a virus or malware.

The latest version of Internet Explorer isn't even available on Windows XP. If you're still using XP, you're probably using IE 8 -- which is more than two versions old.

Instead, move to Firefox or Google Chrome. Mozilla and Google have committed to supporting XP for at least another year.

Prepare or begin your upgrade/migration plan

If you're still using Windows XP, it's probably for one of three reasons:

You have a laptop or desktop from before 2007 and XP is what works.

Change is hard, and upgrading costs money.

You have a very specific application that only works with XP, such as Microsoft Money.

Again, unless you happen to be a government institution that still uses XP for a very specific reason, you need to STOP USING WINDOWS XP. I cannot stress this enough. It's not just that the operating system is old and that there are security issues. It's not just that Microsoft has released three successors to XP. It's not just that new machines are more powerful, have better battery life or power efficiency, and are less expensive than ever before. It's that Windows XP is not safe to use.

Because XP is so old -- and popular -- its flaws are better known than most operating systems. Hackers have targeted Windows XP with aplomb for years -- and that was while Microsoft was providing security patch support. Without that support, users are vulnerable.

So regardless of the reasons you're still using XP, start preparing to move to a new operating system right now.

Choose a new operating system

If your existing computer can support Windows 8.1, you can upgrade for $199. But rather than spending $199 on software, you might want to look at getting a new computer or laptop.

Microsoft has a bunch of Windows 8.1 machines available on its website with special deals(Opens in a new window) for Windows XP users.

Yes, Windows 8.1 is different than Windows XP, and not all of those changes are necessarily positive. The good news is that the new Windows 8.1 Update, available today, makes the system more like Windows 7 (and thus, Windows XP) than ever before. Assuming you're not using a tablet, it includes the ability to basically turn off Windows 8's tile-based ""Metro"" interface entirely and stick with the traditional desktop you're familiar with.

You may be able to find an older machine that comes with Windows 7. Unless you can get a great price from an authorized source, we'd caution against doing this. It's time to bite the bullet and move on.

And if you want to avoid Windows altogether, you can do that, too. Since Windows XP hit the market, it's become easier to use an operating system other than Windows, even for ""real"" work.

Although buying a Mac is more expensive, plenty of users prefer the experience, and the software available for Apple machines is easily on par with what you can get for Windows. When Mom's Windows XP laptop died a few years ago, I insisted she get a Mac. She'e never been happier.

But a Mac isn't your only other option. Linux is far from perfect, but it has become much more usable in the last few years. Thanks to Ubuntu and distributions such as Linux Mint(Opens in a new window), using Linux no longer has to be scary. There's even a version of Linux(Opens in a new window) that looks just like Windows XP.

The best part about Linux? It's free and it runs on machines both old and new. Even if your current laptop isn't powerful enough to run Windows 8.1, some version of Linux should work on it without a problem. That said, you'll have to use some alternative apps, such as Libre Office instead of Microsoft Office, and GIMP instead of Photoshop Elements.

If you want a good place to look at getting started with Linux, check out the Ubuntu Manual Project(Opens in a new window).

Most users spend most of their time in a web browser. If that's the case, you might want to look at a Chromebook, which is inexpensive and offers a good experience for the web-centric user. Another option might be to get an iPad or Android tablet and a Bluetooth keyboard.

Back up and migrate your data

Moving away from Windows XP, especially if you've had a machine for a long time, can be hard. Fortunately, a number of services make it easier.

If you're going to migrate to another Windows machine, Microsoft has teamed up with Laplink to allow users to easily migrate their data.

The PCmover Express(Opens in a new window) app is free and will move over personal files, user profiles and settings to a Windows 7 or later machine.

PCmover Express will not move over applications -- so make sure you have copies of your installation disks and serial numbers for anything you use day-to-day.

Transfer and back up your Windows XP files. Credit: Microsoft

If you want to move your apps over too, PCmover Professional(Opens in a new window) is just $23.95 for XP users.

If you're interested in moving to OS X, Apple makes it easy. You can either bring your existing computer into the Genius Bar when you buy your Mac at an Apple Store and get help migrating data over that way, or you can use the Windows Migration Assistant(Opens in a new window) Apple provides to move Windows data to OS X.

Again, the Migration Assistant won't bring over apps -- but it will bring over email, contacts, calendar files, bookmarks, system settings, photos, and music and video files.

Use a virtual machine

Windows XP running in a virtual machine. Credit:

If you absolutely must stick with Windows XP -- maybe there is an app that won't run under Windows 8.1 -- we highly recommend upgrading your day-to-day system and only running XP in a virtual machine.

Think of a virtual machine as a computer that exists within a computer. It means you can run an entire instance of Windows XP on top of another operating system. The benefit here is that nothing in the virtual machine can contaminate other apps or files on the main system.

So if you have to use XP for one specific program, consider doing it in a virtual machine using something like VirtualBox(Opens in a new window), VMWare Fusion or Parallels Desktop. The great thing about VirtualBox is that it's free and it works with Windows, Linux and OS X. That means you can upgrade to a new OS and still have a virtual copy of your Windows XP machine around for times you need to access Microsoft Money files.

Change is hard, but necessary

I know that for some users, moving away from Windows XP is a chore. I can understand the resentment over moving away from something that still seems to work.

It's a testament to the success of XP (and the failure of its successor, Windows Vista) that the OS has lasted this long.

But change is necessary. Computers aren't like TV sets or microwaves or refrigerators that are designed to run without updates or maintenance for 10+ years. Maybe someday computers will be like that, but today, they require updates -- especially if you want to keep the information stored on them and transmitted between them secure.",4/8/2014 0:00,0.486034,6,9,0,4.852806,7,00000,3046.5,5982.464,4531.574,6700,0.464056,0.129279,0.055198,0.024839,0,0,1300

Little did Platz know that it would be more than 100 years before his message in a bottle would be found and delivered.

SEE ALSO: Bottle Captures Everyday Noises and Creates Music

Discovered by Konrad Fischer, a German fisherman, the bottle was found near the northern city of Kiel last month. Fischer almost threw it back into the sea before noticing Platz's postcard inside, which asked whoever found the bottle to return it to his address in Berlin.

Researchers helped identify and track down Platz via the postcards's address, according to the Agence France-Presse(Opens in a new window). Platz, who was 20 years old at the time, was on a hike with a nature group when he threw the bottle in the Baltic Sea. One hundred years later, a genealogical researcher based in Berlin helped locate Platz's granddaughter, now 62-year-old Angela Erdmann.

Last week, Erdmann got to hold the bottle after visiting the International Maritime Museum in Hamburg, Germany.

""That was a pretty moving moment,"" Erdmann told the AFP(Opens in a new window). ""Tears rolled down my cheeks.""

While Erdmann never knew Platz, who died in 1946, she revisited old family scrapbooks to discover what she could about her grandfather, soon after hearing about the bottle. Erdmann learned that Platz was a Social Democrat, and liked to read, according to the AFP.

The Danish postcard, which included two stamps with images of the German Empire, is dated May 17, 1913. The International Maritime Museum believes it is a century old -- the oldest message in a bottle ever found. While the bottle's message will become 101 in May, others claim that older ones have been found(Opens in a new window).

7009015,This Monster Sandwich Is Brought to You by the Letters A to Z,"The alphabet never tasted so d-E-licious.

One food blogger's latest creation grants a wish we didn't know existed. That is, to tackle a sandwich that represents the English alphabet from A to Z.

Nick Chipman of Dude Foods(Opens in a new window) cooked up the Alphabet Sandwich, piled high with 26 toppings that each represent a different letter.

Certain letters, like X, presented a limited selection of toppings. Chipman eventually settled on Xyolycarp, a fruit type that includes the coconut. For more common letters, choosing just one food proved to be a challenge.

""As far as deciding on which toppings to choose, I sort of just started going through my refrigerator and freezer and finding whatever I could at home, so not having to run to the grocery store for too much probably played the biggest decision in what was on it,"" Chipman told Mashable.

Chipman admits that though he did eat the sandwich, he had to disassemble it first. ""The idea behind it was awesome, but it wasn't too functional as an actual sandwich just because it was probably about a foot-and-a-half tall,"" he said.

Though it's difficult for your taste buds to believe that toppings like Doritos and coconut can peacefully coexist on one sandwich, Chipman said certain toppings unexpectedly worked together.

""The Krispy Kreme doughnut ended up being right on top of the veal parmesan, and those two things were surprisingly good together. Obviously the Krispy Kreme doughnut burger has been around for a while, but a Krispy Kreme doughnut with veal parmesan in the middle could definitely be the next big food that you see at state fairs across the country.""

7009004,Why Are There So Many Auto Recalls These Days?,"Toyota announced a global recall of 6.4 million vehicles on Wednesday -- a move that, on the heels of General Motors' recall of 6.3 million vehicles, added up to a public relations crisis for the auto industry.

Industry experts say more recalls are likely for a variety of reasons, including software-related glitches, modular manufacturing processes and, perhaps most of all, mounting fear among other automakers that they may be next.

[seealso slug=""http://mashable.com/2014/04/09/car-recalls-2014""]

Todd Turner, a consultant at Car Concepts(Opens in a new window) in Thousand Oaks, Calif., says automakers like Toyota are being proactive to avoid a scandal similar to GM's. ""When everyone sees the results of a recall that has been delayed, I think people go back through their processes and ask, 'Is this something we should address or we'll have egg on our face?'"" he says.

In a different climate, Turner says, the issues Toyota addressed in its latest recall would have been handled with a Technical Service Bulletin, a more low-key communication that alerts car owners about potential issues with their vehicles.

""I think they're being overly cautious,"" Turner says of Toyota.

David Kiley, an analyst with New Roads Media, agrees. ""The Toyota fine and GM recall has changed the paradigm for automakers. They have gone from a [point of view] of 'How can we avoid a recall?' to 'Let's just do a recall on this and fix it right, and fix it fast,'"" Kiley says. ""So, we are seeing companies look at their operations, repair data, accident data and processes anew, and so they are going to be calling more recalls. The cost of letting finance guys and lawyers talk the organizations into avoiding recalls if at all possible are over, at least for now.""

The same could be said of others as well. In 2012, a year in which 45% more cars were recalled than sold in the U.S., 68.2% of recalls(Opens in a new window) were initiated by automakers, rather than consumer complaints.

GM is another story. Turner thinks there will be more recall announcements to come. ""There will be an ongoing slew of recalls from them,"" he says. ""They went a very long period of time without any recalls. That's not typical of the business and not typical of GMâ€™s history.""

While the public climate may be prompting some proactive recalls, Roger Lanctot, associate director of Strategy Analytics, blames onboard software and algorithms related to airbag deployment. Lanctot points out that GM, Nissan, Toyota and Chrysler, among others, have instituted recalls related to the technology over the last two years.

""This is just the beginning of software recalls,"" Lanctot says. ""In the past it was all about mechanical failures.""

Another possible factor is the auto industry's use of modular components. As The Wall Street Journal points out, more and more carmakers are using more and more components across different models. While that saves costs, ""if things do go wrong, auto makers can have a hard time containing them,"" the article notes.

Despite the recent wave of recalls, Turner doesn't think 2014 will break 2004's record of 30.8 million. He adds that there's nothing unusual about recalls, either. ""They all do it,"" he says. ""Even Mercedes has recalls.""

That doesn't mean that cars are any less safe than in the past. The number of annual motor vehicle traffic fatalities fell 8% this past decade, versus the previous one, according to the NHTSA.

â€œWhile recalls are important, defects play a very small role in the overall highway safety picture,â€ Russ Rader, a rep for the nonprofit Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, says. â€œRecall numbers may go up or down, but vehicles in 2014 are much safer than vehicles 10 or 15 years ago.""",4/9/2014 0:00,0.422049,13,6,0,4.125136,7,Tech,0,3574.499,2556.303,8300,0.524217,0.280968,0.057671,0.025027,0,0,946

7026378,9-Month-Old Sent Into Hiding After Attempted Murder Charge in Pakistan,"A 9-month-old Pakistani boy accused of attempted murder is reportedly being sent into hiding because of the furor surrounding the case.

Musa Khan can barely fit his hands around a milk bottle, but he was charged with attempted murder in Lahore, Pakistan after members of his family allegedly attacked(Opens in a new window) gas company employees who threatened to disconnect the gas flow to homes of customers who had not paid their bills. Khan's whole family was accused of attempted murder in February, which is how Khan got slapped with the charge.

The boy's grandfather, Muhammad Yasin, said on Tuesday that he is forced to send the baby to Faisalabad, roughly 116 miles away.

The case has turned Pakistani police into something of an international laughingstock. It has also spotlighted a legal system that can quickly charge a baby with a serious crime but has struggled to bring Taliban militants and other criminals to trial.

Reports of human rights infractions and amateurism within the Pakistani police are common, according to reports. Human Rights Watch says police forces are incapable of defending against attacks(Opens in a new window) from militants, yet some militants have seemingly vanished(Opens in a new window) in their custody. The police have also been accused of ""extrajudicial killings"" and torturing suspected criminals.

Muhammad Yasin held the boy as he was thumb-printed by officials on April 3, after which he sucked on a milk bottle(Opens in a new window). While many children of his age are still learning how to crawl, Khan has been accused of attempted murder.

Khan is scheduled to make his next court appearance on April 12, though it remains unclear whether that will happen, both because he is in hiding and because the attempted murder charge is likely to be dropped soon, according to Reuters(Opens in a new window).

Rana Sanaullah Khan, the law minister overseeing the case, has ordered an investigation into how a 9-month-old could be charged with such a crime, and one police officer has been suspended(Opens in a new window).

TransferWise(Opens in a new window), an international money exchange service, says thatâ€™s no way to treat a customer trying to transfer money, either. The company, co-founded by one of Skypeâ€™s first employees Taavet Hinrikus, set up a prank video in a London pub to make a point about big banksâ€™ tendencies to syphon money off the top.

[seealso slug=""transferwise""]

The ad is another in a long line of hidden-camera stunts that capture consumersâ€™ reactions to sometimes-outlandish scenarios. Brands around the world are continuing to latch onto prankvertising, or shockvertising, as a way of getting their messages noticed and shared.

TransferWise, a startup with investors that include PayPal founder Max Levchin, posted the video on its blog under the headline: â€œBad news. Your bank just opened a bar. It doesnâ€™t end well.â€

The ad shows thirsty patrons, obviously expecting a full pour, startled at the barkeepâ€™s big gulps. He, predictably, gets sloshed on the spoils.

Hinrikus has said in interviews that he and his co-founder Kristo Kaarmann stumbled on the idea for TransferWire while trying to send money back and forth between jobs in London and their home bases in Estonia. With banks taking at least 5% of the transfer amount, often in hidden fees, the friends started circumventing the system by exchanging with each other.

Single Band (2.4 GHz): This bandwidth is best for simple home networks, meaning you basically just like to browse the web on your laptop from time to time, but you're not into the heavy streaming stuff. It's cheaper, and it will give you a strong signal for longer distances.

Dual Band (5 GHz): Calling all gamers and streaming junkies, you might want to jump on the less crowded 5 GHz bandwidth. Fewer devices work with it, which makes it less crowded and much faster, but you'll want to make sure that all of your gadgets are compatible.

The Bluez 2 Bluetooth headset wirelessly connects to your mobile device, allowing you to listen to music and make or hang up phone calls -- all while keeping your ears open to the natural sounds around you.

[seealso slug=""headphones-tips""]

Stunning good looks

The wraparound device is easily one of the most attractive of its type that I've seen to date. Unlike some other behind-the-neck headphones that seem to scream ""Look at me and my special curvy headphones,"" these are far more conservative and thus usable in any setting, no matter what your style or appearance.

After debuting the first version(Opens in a new window) of the Bluez headphones in 2013, Aftershokz apparently decided to go back to the drawing board, and develop a design that consumers of advanced smartphones have become accustomed to from the likes of Samsung and HTC. Wearable-tech makers would do well to follow the Aftershokz's example: Subtle works best in mobile environments (I'm looking at you, Google Glass).

Made out of durable black plastic, the Bluez 2 looks and feels like something that could have come from the Frog(Opens in a new window) or Apple design studio -- that is, except for one small feature: the multi-function button. The silver button, which allows you to start and stop music and hang up phone calls, is the only part of the device that deviates from its otherwise beautiful design.

What they feel like

The first thing that came to mind upon first seeing the Bluez 2 was Geordi La Forge's visor from Star Trek: The Next Generation -- of course, you slide the device around the back of your head instead of in front of your eyes, but the design fits just as seamlessly onto the human head. And for people with particularly small noggins, the package comes with an elastic tension band that will make the device a snug fit for anyone.

Runners and gym rats will also enjoy how the device stays in place, even during vigorous workouts. As for moisture, Aftershokz claims the Bluez 2 has a ""sweat-resistant design,"" but I didn't put that to the test.

Invisible interface

By far my favorite aspect of the Bluez 2 is how Aftershokz handled its interface. On the hardware side, the volume buttons, charging outlet and power indicator are all discreetly placed on one side of the device's wraparound arms. You have to search for them to even know they're there, but once you do, accessing the controls while wearing the device feels amazingly natural.

There's also an audio component to the interface. When you've successfully paired the Bluez 2 to your mobile device via Bluetooth, a gentle voice whispers ""connected"" into your ear. And when the device isn't paired to your mobile device, you can check the battery setting by pressing the volume controls (if it's fully charged, that same voice will say ""battery high"").

Credit: Mashable

What it's good for

The fact that there are still so many traditional over-the-ear headphones on the market is a sign that bone-conducting headphones arenâ€™t for everyone. That's true in the case of the Bluez 2, as well.

I found that when playing sounds with heavy bass (e.g. electronic music, hip-hop), the vibrations to my outer ear were just a bit too irritating to continue at anything but the lowest volume.

Speaking of musical genres, I noticed significantly more sound leakage when playing hard rock, hip-hop and electronic music, as compared to jazz and classical, where I detected almost no sound leakage, even at high volumes.

On its website, Aftershokz touts its patented ""LeakSlayer"" technology, a feature specifically designed to defeat this kind of sound leakage. But I was still able to detect sound leakage from the headphones when playing rock music at normal volumes from a distance of just 5 feet away.

The New York City subway test

Part of the appeal of these kinds of headphones is their ability to allow you to hear normal sounds while listening to audio from your mobile device. But this is a tricky proposition on the New York City subway, where the screeching of trains barreling down the tracks often drowned out the sound playing on the Bluez 2 -- no matter how high the audio was turned up.

So if you happen to be a frequent commuter, I'd advise you to pay special attention to the amount of noise emitted during your trip. On the NYC subway, I found the Bluez 2 to be mostly unusable.

Credit: Mashable, Will Fenstermaker

Shortcomings, but just a few

Sound leakage and only being able to effectively use the device in certain settings are the two main issues with a mostly flawless device. But there are other points that some may want to be aware of: The battery only lasts six hours, with about 10 hours standby time, which means you'll need to make sure you keep the USB charging cord with you as often as possible.

Another issue, which is really down to design aesthetics, is the fact that the device doesn't fold up when not in use. I love the design so much that I think the lack of a fold-up option is worth the trade-off. But I did find it difficult to decide where to place the device when I was on the go, and needed to take it off briefly.

At $99.95, the Bluez 2 are a little pricey. But overall, if you're looking for bone-conducting headphones that are beautiful, practical and fade into the background, the Bluez 2 are an easy choice.

Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel comes two years after the release of Borderlands 2, which Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford said was one of 2K's best-selling games ever, with 8.5 million copies sold.

""We still haven't met fans demands for content,"" Pitchford told Mashable during a reveal of the game. Borderlands 2 had eight different downloadable content packs after its release, each spanning several additional hours of gameplay.

This ""pre-sequel"" -- or as Pitchford joked, ""Borderlands 1.5"" -- takes place between the first and second Borderlands games. Players control four new characters and work with not-yet-villain Handsome Jack, long before he becomes a megalomaniacal force in Borderlands 2.

""We wanted to make Jack more of a sympathetic character,"" said Gearbox writer Anthony Burch, who added it will be interesting for fans to contrast the Handsome Jack from both these games to the unannounced villain in the Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel. ""You might end up rooting for her.""

The four playable characters will all be somewhat familiar to die-hard series fans, as they all made appearances in Borderlands 2. They include Athena, an Atlus Assassin and former member of the Crimson Lance; Wilhelm, a man turned cyborg that was actually seen as a boss in Borderlands 2; Nisha the Lawbreaker; and an upgraded version of sassy, foul-mouthed, fan-favorite robot Claptrap.

The stats, skills and feel of the game will all be familiar to players, as The Pre-Sequel uses the Borderlands 2 engine. The game has been in development for over a year by 2K Australia; the studio took on the project just after finishing BioShock Infinite.

Characters now have oxygen tanks that let them bounce around in low gravity, crossing large chasms and more quickly dodging foes. There's even a way to shoot up and ""ground pound"" on your enemies from above, using your weight to do damage.

""It all sort of made sense to me. I wasn't interested in making a YouTube movie, I was interested in making something really good,"" Goldfine said. ""And when I saw the three of them I knew, it's not just their 'celebrity' ... it's their intelligence their experience. And they're scrappy. They want to figure out a way to make this work and be successful. They're crafty and they think of way to do things to get the movie out there.""

Hart said they met with a single idea in common: to make a feature film about summer camp. The rest fell into place as they began to realize that they had similar creative sensibilities.

""Michael took a real risk with working with us,"" Hart said. ""As a YouTube personality, it's hard to convince somebody that you have that background. Michael invested in that, and that's really hard to convince someone to do.""

Although they were essentially learning the craft of moviemaking along the way, they saw their YouTube experience as an asset.

""The fact that we made a movie from concept to meeting to finished production in just a year ... it's kind of like, we make a video, we put it up the next day,"" Hart said.

Not that she was trying to make it sound easy: Helbig said she maintained her YouTube channel throughout the process, turning it into a mini-documentary about the movie and its crew. That was just part of a massive fan-engagement effort that helped fund the film, not through Kickstarter or traditional crowdfunding, but with merchandise sales and other pre-release revenue that basically put them in the black before the movie was even released.

""It was very different,"" Helbig said. ""I was maintaining a five-day-a-week YouTube schedule at the same time, editing at night and showing back up on the set at five or six in the morning. There were a few panic attacks and breakdowns that happened.""

The good news: Unlike DIY YouTube videos, moviemaking involves a whole lot of supporting cast.

""The really great thing about YouTube videos, you shot and edit and post ... but with the movie it was like 'Oh you're gonna focus on my face? And you're gonna edit this? Oh, this is great!""

7008925,Canada Freezes Online Tax Filing Due to Heartbleed Bug,"Canada's tax authority shut down its online tax-filing services on Tuesday night to safeguard taxpayers' information after the major security bug Heartbleed was exposed.

Canada's Revenue Agency (CRA) temporarily blocked access to its online tax filing services as a ""preventative"" measure to ""safeguard the integrity of the information we hold,"" a spokeswoman told the The Wall Street Journal(Opens in a new window). The measure was taken as ""a precaution until the agency can be sure the risks have been eliminated."" The deadline for most Canadians to file taxes is April 30.

Heartbleed is an encryption security bug affecting the servers using the popular open-source software package OpenSSL. Estimates says it's used by two-thirds of the entire Internet, and the bug potentially exposes a great deal of sensitive information such as passwords, credit card numbers and emails. Essentially, if a website uses an unpatched version of OpenSSL, a malicious hacker can then access data that are supposed to be protected.

OpenSSL has had this bug for almost two years, but its existence was revealed(Opens in a new window) only on Monday. Researchers found it possible to trick servers running OpenSSL into sending information that was supposedly protected, transmitting the contents of the server's memory.

After the announcement, many vulnerable websites like Yahoo and OKCupid have patched the bug -- some more quickly than others -- but other sites are still in the process of updating their servers, which leaves their user's information potentially vulnerable.

The CRA provided the following statement to The Toronto Star(Opens in a new window):

The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) places first priority on ensuring the confidentiality of taxpayer information.

We have received information concerning an Internet security vulnerability named the Heartbleed Bug. As a preventative measure, the CRA has temporarily shut down public access to our online services to safeguard the integrity of the information we hold. Applications include online services like EFILE, NETFILE, My Account, My Business Account and Represent a Client.

The CRA recognizes that this problem may represent a significant inconvenience for individual Canadians, representatives and businesses that count on the CRA for online information and services. Please be assured that we are fully engaged in resolving this matter and restoring online services as soon as possible in a manner that ensures the private information of Canadians remains safe and secure.

Please note that consideration will also be given to taxpayers who are unable to comply with their filing requirements because of this service interruption.

We are committed to investigating any potential impacts to taxpayer information. We will provide further information and daily updates at 3PM EST on our home page until the situation is resolved.

The filing services will be down until further notice.

So far this year, car companies have recalled about 13 million cars in the United States, compared to 22 million(Opens in a new window) last year, according to the National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration. The previous record was 30.8 million in 2004.

[seealso slug=""tesla-dream-available-to-all""]

Ford: 434,000 vehicles

Ford is recalling vehicles for two separate issues. The first involves some 385,750 Escape models from 2001 to 2004. The models have subframes that tend to rust when exposed to road salt, which could result in diminished steering control (about 349,000 of the affected vehicles are in the U.S.). Dealers are installing a reinforcement cross brace to remedy the problem; one crash has already been cause by the subframe issue, but no injuries or deaths have been reported.

Ford's other recall affects 49,950 cars, including the 2013 and 2014 Ford Fusion, Lincoln MKZ, Escape and C-Max models whose seatbacks were not welded properly. There have been no deaths, injuries or accidents reported as a result of the problem. About 86% of the affected vehicles -- some 42,972 -- are in the U.S., and the rest are in Canada.

More information can be found on Ford's recall site(Opens in a new window).

General Motors: 4.8 million vehicles

Most of GM's recalls are related to an ignition switch issue that dates back to 2002 and has been linked to 13 deaths. Due to a glitch, some 2.6 million GM vehicles have been known to shut off while the cars were in motion, disabling its power steering and airbags. The recall affects all 2005-2007 Chevrolet Cobalts, plus 2006-2007 Chevy HHRs, 2006-2007 Pontiac Solstices, 2007 Saturn Skys and 2003-2007 Saturn Ions. The 2005-2006 Pontiac Pursuits sold in Canada were affected as well.

On March 31, GM also recalled another 1.5 million vehicles -- 1.3 million of which are in the U.S. -- because the cars can unexpectedly lose their power steering. The models involved in this latest recall are the 2010 Cobalt, the 2009-2010 Chevy HHR compact and the 2004-07 Saturn ION compact. Three of the six models are also part of the earlier recall. More information can be found on a website dedicated to the GM recall(Opens in a new window).

Toyota: 6.4 million vehicles

Toyota issued a broad recall related to five types of safety hazards on Wednesday. The recall affects 27 Toyota models, including the Yaris, Corolla and RAV4, as well as Pontiac Vibe and Subaru Trezia, the two models Toyota built for General Motors and Fuji Heavy Industries.

Toyota is recalling a majority of the cars -- some 3.5 million vehicles globally, 2.34 million of which were sold in North America -- due to problems with a spiral cable, which could be damaged when the steering wheel is turned, causing the air bag to fail. Other issues include problems with a spring that locks the seat rail in its position, steering columns, windscreen wipers and a fire risk with engine starters.

Toyota said none of the issues described above have caused crashes, injuries or fatalities. More information about the recall can be found on Toyota's website(Opens in a new window).

Nissan: 1 million vehicles

The recall affects 2013-2014 Altimas, Leafs, Pathfinders and Sentras for a software problem that could prevent the passenger-side airbag from deploying in an accident.

Volkswagen: 160,351 vehicles

7027439,Hands On With Carousel: Dropbox's New Photo-Organization App,"Dropbox released Carousel(Opens in a new window), the file-hosting service's new app for organizing and and sharing photos and videos, at an event in San Francisco Wednesday.

The app enables users to view and organize all of their images that have been shared or backed up using Dropbox -- without having to store them locally on their device.

[seealso slug= ""dropbox-project-harmony-mailbox-android/""]

One of Carousel's most useful features appears before you even sign in: the ability to automatically back up your device's camera roll. Once enabled, all the photos you take will automatically be synced to Dropbox when connected to Wi-Fi (syncing over Wi-Fi is the default setting, but users can also choose to sync over a data connection).

Photos are grouped chronologically by event, with the most recent appearing first. At the bottom of the app is a scrollable timeline that lets you jump between years or months.

Dropbox's Carousel app groups your images by event. Individual photos can be shared or hidden from the app. Credit: Carousel

Overall, the app is surprisingly responsive. Using the slider, navigating between hundreds of images that span years only takes as long as it takes to swipe across the bottom of your screen. Images load almost instantly with no noticeable lag -- even without a Wi-Fi connection.

Obviously, the app relies on Dropbox's ecosystem, so if you haven't backed up or shared many photos to Dropbox, the app won't show much beyond what's on your camera roll.

Dropbox has also built a platform for private messaging into the app. Users can share any photo, or a group of photos, with friends via email or text message. If photos are shared with people who do not have the Carousel app installed, they can view a preview of the image, but will need to download the app in order to save it or respond.

Carousel allows users to message photos to friends even if they don't have the app/ Credit: Carousel

Dropbox is billing Carousel as a way to store memories; this sentiment seems almost cheesy at first, but if you have years of images on Dropbox, the app may surprise you.

When I first logged on, I was pleasantly surprised to discover that Carousel resurfaced a series of photos -- now almost 10 years old -- that I thought only existed on an old external drive. As it turns out, the images had been sitting in my Dropbox account for more than two years, but had gotten lost among my many folders and files.

However, the app noticeably lacks several features -- a search function, for example -- but given that this is Carousel's first release, we'll likely see more features added in future updates.

It's also worth pointing out that by encouraging users to back up and save all their images to Dropbox, the company may be subtly pushing users toward upgrading to paid accounts.

Dropbox currently offers 2 GB of free storage under its free plan, although that amount can be increased up to 16 GB by referring friends or participating in other promotions. Even so, 16 GB will go quickly if users are storing a large number of photos in their accounts. Pro accounts start at $9.99 a month (or $99 a year) for 100 GB of storage.",4/9/2014 0:00,0.649852,40,0,18,4.915966,10,Entertainment,0,8439.371,4972.374,10550,0.444624,0.05154,0.033613,0.022409,0.3,0.2,5500
7028806,CNN Partners With Twitter for New 15-Second Video Series,"If you want to tune in to CNN's newest morning show, all you have to do is look to your Twitter feed.

CNN is partnering with Twitter for a new video series called Your 15 Second Morning, which will highlight one or more big topics from the day in a 15-second clip embedded natively on the social network and shared from CNN's main Twitter account.

With this effort, CNN is taking a page from NowThis News, which airs short news videos tailored for specific social networks like Instagram and Vine.

""NowThis News has done a great job of tailoring content for the mobile and social audience and they shouldn't quite honestly be the only ones doing it,"" Andrew Morse, a senior VP at CNN US, told Mashable.

The video series is part of a larger initiative from the news company called CNN Digital Studios, which kicked off in late 2013. The Digital Studios team consists of 10-12 people who are focused on creating new online video franchises and series.

As part of this effort, the team is working to create spinoffs around existing CNN personalities like Dr. Sanjay Gupta and shows like Crossfire. One soon-to-launch series will feature a ""young, edgy urban chef,"" who is a favorite of CNN's Anthony Bourdain. These programs may be eight to 10 minutes in length.

The programs are intended to be companions to what airs on TV, though Morse says it can serve as a testing ground for content that could be featured on TV later.

""The way many television networks have approached digital video historically is to take live television, cut it up and put it online,"" Morse says. ""What we've come to realize over time is that's not the kind of video that the online audience and mobile audience are demanding. We are reverse engineering the process.""

For now, Your 15 Second Morning is the only series that CNN Digital Studios is partnering on with Twitter or any other social network. ""We're looking for other great projects,"" Morse says, ""and actively talking with other companies about original video programming.""

The Your 15 Second Morning series and the Digital Studios initiative are both scheduled to be formally announced on Thursday during the CNN Worldwide Upfront event.",4/9/2014 0:00,0.590909,4,0,1,4.414239,8,Business,3342.676,59695.46,11421.72,349050,0.447989,0.245873,0.067961,0.006472,0.1,0.2,4800

Sure, schools like the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Stanford University have a reputation for churning out revolutionary ideas and battle-tested founders, but top-flight companies sprout from universities and entrepreneurship programs all across the country.

Case in point: Jan Koum, the co-founder of mobile messaging company WhatsApp, which recently sold to Facebook for $16 billion, isn't an Ivy League MBA. Instead, he got his bachelor's from San Jose State University.

7028732,7 Quotes That Tell You Everything About the Comcast-Time Warner Cable Merger Hearing,"Two men who stand to gain millions from the proposed Comcast-Time Warner Cable merger were hauled before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday for a hearing that examined the impact it would have on consumers like you.

Comcast Executive Vice President David Cohen and Time Warner Cable CFO Arthur T. Minson made their case for a merger that would see the country's two biggest cable companies form one megacorporation.

SEE ALSO: The National Domination of Comcast and Time Warner in 1 Map

The committee -- which holds broad jurisdiction over antitrust law but cannot decide whether or not the merger will actually happen -- gave consumers a fantastic opportunity to hear from the companies and Senators, who want to know what's in it for the rest of us.

TL;DR These seven quotes pretty much sum up the whole thing.

1. ""I believe this deal will result in fewer choices, higher prices and even worse service for my constituents."" -- Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.)

Credit: Carolyn Kaster, File

Sen. Al Franken has been opposed to the Comcast-Time Warner Cable deal since February, so it came as no surprise when he said on Wednesday that he was against it. Sen. Franken, who claims to have 100,000 signatures from constituents equally concerned, said he believes the merger will result in less competition and higher prices. ""Comcast says there is no overlapping footprint, but it wants to control the national market,â€ Franken said. â€œAs it gets bigger it will have more power to squeeze consumers.â€

2. ""They just want to know why their cable bills keep going up."" -- Sen. Pat Leahy (D-Vt.)

Credit: Pablo Martinez Monsivais

Sen. Patrick Leahy, in his opening testimony, said consumers didn't want to hear complex legal jargon or obscure regulatory terms in Wednesday's hearing. ""They want to know why their cable bills are going up,"" he said. ""They want to know why they do not have more choice of providers. Consumers are trying to find out whether and how this merger is good for them. I want to find out the same things,"" he added.

Americans have seen their cable bills skyrocket over the past 13 years, from a measly $48 per month in 2001 to $128 in 2011. Today, Comcast, on average, collects $156 dollars per month, per customer. ""Outpacing inflation, cable is now so expensive that it creates poverty issues: in poorer households it competes with basics like food, rent, or health insurance. If you wanted to help the poor, you could do worse than cutting cable bills,"" Columbia Law School professor Tim Wu wrote(Opens in a new window) in The New Yorker.

Sen. Blumenthal said Comcast had not fully demonstrated the benefits consumers have to gain in its proposed merger with TWC, adding that he believes the deal faces(Opens in a new window) â€œa high degree of skepticism.""

After filing its statement of â€œpublic interestâ€ with the Federal Communications Commission earlier this week, Comcastâ€™s David Cohen attempted to argue that consumers would benefit from the deal on a conference call on Tuesday.

â€œThis transaction means a host of exciting benefits for consumers: faster Internet speeds, a fully upgraded network, the extension of the FCCâ€™s open internet rules to TWC customers and nationally acclaimed and comprehensive low-income broadband adoption, the best in class video and technology user interface, the best alternative to traditional voice services, and a commitment to diversity and making broadband accessible to people with disabilities,â€ he said, ticking off a list of improvements(Opens in a new window) the company hopes customers will soon see.

Sen. Blumenthal, however, wasn't sold. Speaking to Cohen in Wednesday's hearing, he asked, â€œWhereâ€™s the beef? Whereâ€™s the 'there' there for consumers? I think the case has yet to be made the consumers will benefit in a really tangible way.â€

A series of women were invited to be a part of a research group to test a product called RB-X -- a patch worn directly on the arm. Participants were asked to leave the patch on for 12 hours a day (for two weeks) and record a video diary about how they felt throughout the process.

Participants weren't told what was inside the RB-X patch, but knew it was supposed to enhance the way they see their own beauty.

7028664,Facebook's Not Messing Around: Messenger Will Be the Only Way to Chat on Mobile,"When Facebook acquired standalone messaging app WhatsApp in February for $16 billion, the future of its own messaging app, Messenger, suddenly became unclear.

Facebook seems to have settled those questions Wednesday: It's making sure Messenger is here for the long haul.

[seealso slug=""social-network-messaging-vine""]

Facebook will soon force all users to send messages through Messenger by eliminating the chat features from its traditional iOS and Android versions of the app, a spokesperson confirmed to Mashable. Facebook has started notifying users of the change, with some in Europe receiving the notification today.

Those users will have two weeks to download Messenger before the service within the main app disappears, according to TechCrunch(Opens in a new window), which first reported the news.

""Today we are starting to notify people that messages are moving out of the Facebook app and over to the Messenger app,"" a spokesperson wrote in a statement to Mashable. ""To continue sending messages on mobile, people will need to install the Messenger app.""

If you have both the main app and Messenger on your phones, you already complete all messaging through Messenger; the messages tab within the main app redirects you. Those who do not are prompted to download Messenger with little pop-ups from the company that highlight Messenger's functionality, but users did not need to download in order to continue messaging their Facebook friends.

Currently, users who don't have Messenger are prompted to download it when going into the messaging tab on Facebook's main app. Credit: Kurt Wagner/Mashable

Despite the proliferation of ecommerce apps, when it comes to apparel and accessories, shopping from your phone can fall short.

But that doesn't mean there's any less fun to be had on your phone for fashion enthusiasts. Expressing yourself through fashion is an art, and one inherently suited for both socially integrated apps as well as fashion games that let you play stylist.

The app's beautiful interface is reminiscent of print design; but unlike flipping through a magazine, you can drag and drop products you like into the messaging box to get your friends' opinions. Whisp also integrates with Facebook, so your friends can message with you on Whisp without downloading the app themselves.

2. ASAP54

If you've ever struggled to Google those shoes you saw out and about by color, style, texture and so on -- you'll appreciate why ASAP54 created a reverse photo search for fashion, launched on iOS(Opens in a new window) in February.

If you find taking photos of strangers' clothes in public to be awkward, remember that you can use a photo you found online, too.

The concept is catching on. Style Eyes(Opens in a new window) has a similar app for brands in Europe, and Slyce is creating a technology that could be used by retailers on their own websites.

3. Pose

Pose is a weather app infused with the real reason we check the weather -- to decide what to wear. By checking your location, Pose determines your local weather forecast and provides photos and collections to inspire your outfit for the day. You can further narrow down the selections by telling Pose you're going to the office, heading to the gym or wearing skinny jeans, to name a few options.

Pose is available on Android(Opens in a new window) and iOS(Opens in a new window).

The worst scenario when bringing home a great fashion find is realizing that the fit is not quite right, or the piece doesn't belong with the rest of your wardrobe. Either it sits in the lonely end of your closet, or you can sell it on one of these apps.

Poshmark(Opens in a new window)'s website and mobile app is resale specifically for fashion, and you can add several pictures with each item, along with noting the size, color, brand and more. Other users can comment on or repost your items, which can help you make a sale. Many users have fun with styling their own items, so the social stream is as much inspiration as ecommerce. Poshmark takes a 20% commission on sales over $15, and is available on iOS(Opens in a new window) and Android(Opens in a new window).

Like Poshmark, you can buy and sell fashion on Bib + Tuck(Opens in a new window), but the platform only accepts select brands. Thus, the items for sale on the site are guaranteed to be of higher quality, or at least from premium brands. Bib + Tuck uses its own virtual currency, which you can purchase; but when you sell items, you can only exchange your Bib Bucks for more items on the site. Bib + Tuck is available on iOS(Opens in a new window).

Tradesy(Opens in a new window) encourages the buying and selling of premium items by guaranteeing authenticity -- a far cry from the early days of rip-offs on eBay.

For fashion lovers who have more time than money to spend on styling, Covet(Opens in a new window) might be the perfect fit. When you first sign up, the app asks you to vote between a few sets of styles, Ã  la ""hot-or-not."" This process will earn you tickets, while you earn cash by entering contests -- and you'll use the in-app cash to ""buy"" dresses, shoes, handbags and more. Once you've built your closet, you can begin styling looks for various contests in the app, such as Secret Rendezvous in Belize or Opening Night of a Broadway Show.

Covet is available on both iOS(Opens in a new window) and Android(Opens in a new window).

8-9. Stylebook, Closet+

If you've ever been at a store lusting after a gorgeous dress, but unsure if you have shoes that will match, you've probably wished for a virtual closet. Stylebook(Opens in a new window) for iOS(Opens in a new window) is $3.99 and allows you to add images of the clothes you own, as well as lay out an outfit in a collage, make a packing list and create calendars of what you plan to wear. It can help you shop more efficiently, in case you forget what you already have, and help you make sure a favorite accessory doesn't collect dust, forgotten in your closet.

Similarly, Closet+(Opens in a new window) allows you to upload photos of the apparel you own, and is a free app for iOS. Mix Me(Opens in a new window) is a similar app on Android.

10. The Hunt

The Hunt(Opens in a new window) calls itself the ""cure for outfit envy,"" and is perhaps a community-driven version of the reverse photo search of ASAP54.

Culture of collaboration... I joined PlaceIQ for the culture of collaboration that comes with an early stage startup. Prior to my current role, I was vice president of integrated and strategic partnerships at AT&T. What really drew me to PlaceIQ were the unique technologies and capabilities that it offers customers at an early stage. In this noisy industry, PlaceIQ is able to set itself apart from the crowd because of the way it interprets and analyzes mobile data and location. It's unlike anything I have seen before, which made the opportunity to work here irresistible.

Plugging in... The beauty of a startup is that you can plug in and start playing almost immediately. Startups begin with a certain set of positions in mind, but as the company grows, those roles tend to change based on the strengths of the company, the employees and what's needed to move forward as quickly and as successfully as possible. In my case, I began as the head of client strategy and quickly discovered that I had an interest in doing much more than that. Then, as the company expanded, I had the freedom to pursue those interests. That's what is so great about working at a startup -- things move fast and competition is [abundant], so employees have the opportunity to bend and twist as needed to make sure the company can break through the noise and do great things.

The future of analytics... I was originally drawn to the company because of its proprietary platform and powerful technology, both of which only get better as time goes on. One of the great things about PlaceIQ's technology is the extensibility. Since I started, we've really articulated a vision for our mobile insights that goes much further than, say, ad delivery. We've reached a point where we can truly say and prove that location is the future of data analytics.

Today, PlaceIQ has 84 employees.

Jumping into the deep end... Coming into this role, I had never worked on an app before, or designed any complex information architecture myself. My first project at Vectorform threw me right into the deep end on both of those things, and I enjoyed the challenge. During my year here, Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to design for iOS, Android, Windows and the web. At larger companies, my roles might be broken down into separate jobs; but at Vectorform, I enjoy being able to take the product from site map through information architecture and user interface design, and then to developers who make sure it looks perfect upon delivery.

Nerf darts and Lego... The company has a relaxed, comfortable atmosphere. There are constantly Nerf darts flying around the office, and we have a healthy love of Lego and video games. Trampoline dodgeball is one of my favorite group activities. What I love most about the culture, though, is the great conversations I have with co-workers about design and technology and where the fields are heading. We have a group of individuals who are always considering the future of our industry and thinking about what we can do to make ourselves an integral part of it.

Company perks... There's a real interest from my bosses in making sure that I care about what I'm working on, that I'm challenged and inspired by that work and that I'm generally happy. That is something unique even for a small company. It's also great that I can spend a week working out of our New York office (where my family and a lot of friends are) or take a trip to Seattle or Munich and work from our offices there.

Today, Vectorform has 94 employees.

Small vs. large startups... I already had experience in the startup world, so I had no reservations about joining another one; I knew what I was getting into at BaubleBar. One of my main reasons for making the transition there was because of the company's small size and my potential to make an impact. I was coming from a larger startup with 600+ employees where I wasn't able to make the impact I knew I was capable of.

'Fish in a vast ocean of rainbows'... Before BaubleBar, I was working at Fab.com(Opens in a new window), which was a great experience -- but I was but one colorful fish in a vast ocean of rainbows there. What excites me about BaubleBar is because it's a smaller startup, I know I'll be able to make my mark.

Following up on promises... One requirement I have when joining a new organization is that they have to have an open, supportive and fun company culture. I asked this of BaubleBar during my interview, and interviewer after interviewer reassured me that I would work hard and also have fun doing it. BaubleBar followed through on the promise. Co-founders Amy Jain(Opens in a new window) and Daniella Yacobovsky(Opens in a new window) set the tone for company -- they work really hard to keep it fun and grounded.

A company in its infancy... I came to The Fresh Diet in a temporary capacity in 2009 at the request of a close family friend (who's also part owner of the company). I had no reservations about a small company. In fact, I preferred joining one. I was 20 years old, and my work experience was about as small as the company itself. I felt that The Fresh Diet -- in its infancy with so much promise -- mirrored my own career goals.

Evolving with the business... My role has evolved substantially over time at TFD. I started as a part-time customer service representative. Then, TFD was small(er), which gave me the opportunity to learn and discover all the intimate workings of the company, a process that eventually set me up for success. My role developed from CS representative, to sales representative, to assistant director of customer service and now to internal business director. The culture at The Fresh Diet has always been naturally supportive; I have never shied away from jumping into a new project or trying to tackle a new challenge, even if that meant crossing a [department] boundary. The more I became involved, the more I found myself fascinated with the idea of becoming more involved with our team.

Down with the doors... The culture at TFD is much more than the typical 'open door' policy; we quite literally have taken many doors off of their hinges at our office to promote open-air teamwork. We group desks together and share offices so we can better work together, share ideas and start conversations.

Today, The Fresh Diet has more than 250 employees.

Ditching the suit... I was immediately attracted to the subtle ""cool factor"" of the startup atmosphere, especially as a means to transition directly out of college into the workforce. When I found out I'd made the final round of interviews for the business development team at Offerpop, a recruiter there told me not to wear a suit to my last interview. ""We are a startup, silly!"" she said. For some reason, that really stuck with me -- not to mention that it lightened the stressful mood, though I admit I spent longer than usual deciding what to wear that day. When I walked into the office, saw the bright orange and yellow walls and was greeted by people who seemed to genuinely enjoy their jobs, I was hooked.

'Not a cold-calling job'... I joined the Offerpop team as a business development representative (BDR), which is a high-volume, intro-to-sales role focused on outbound lead generation. This might sound like a cold-calling job, but thatâ€™s not really true. As a BDR, you're the face of the company for a prospective client, and you're supposed to provide valuable insight and spark enough interest from them to warrant further discussions.

Rapid evolution... After I had been an Offerpop employee for about three months, our company went through internal restructuring that shifted the BDR function to become part of the marketing team. We had the ability to hire a number of new BDRs, and we also needed someone to focus on building out the team to scale with the rest of the company, which is where I stepped in as team lead. I began my new role working through metrics on BDR performance, using that data to update standard processes for efficiency and consistency, and then collaborating on a more targeted on-boarding course for new hires to the BDR position. I currently manage a team of seven, play an active role in the hiring and training of new team members and continue to contribute to outbound outreach efforts.

Keeping things young... Our office has a very team-focused atmosphere, and thatâ€™s especially true of business development, which is largely comprised of recent college graduates. We all sit within a few feet of each other (no cubicles) and we keep the day interesting with call-offs and other challenges. It can get pretty competitive, but always in a fun way. At the end of the day, we're working together to further the goals of the company.

Today, Offerpop has 100 employees.

A focus on feedback... Prior to Stitch Fix, I worked as an assistant buyer at a catalog company based in San Francisco. Coming from a catalog business, where client feedback is limited, I was excited to be more in-touch with our client base at Stitch Fix. Each client we ship a 'Fix' to leaves feedback on the items they receive, which gives us very actionable data on each product. Reading feedback from our clients always keeps me going. Sometimes it's hearing about how confident they felt starting their new job, how great they looked on a first date or how we got them out of their comfort zone. Whatever the impact is, it never fails to keep me motivated!

Starting scrappy... When I started at Stitch Fix as the assistant buyer for tops, my role was pretty scrappy. We had a lot to get done every day, and not a lot of people to do it. My day-to-day tasks ranged from the traditional work of an assistant buyer to editing product copy and decorating conference rooms. As our buying team grows, my role has become more focused, but it's just as intense as it ever was. Now I oversee two subclasses within tops and manage some of our new vendors.

Brand recognition... When I began a year ago, everything we did was on a much smaller scale. Our orders were smaller, our team was smaller and even our industry presence was smaller. We're now writing competitive orders and outgrowing our office space. Everywhere I go these days, someone has heard of Stitch Fix!

Today, Stitch Fix has 500 employees.

Enabling new tech... I joined SoundCloud in November 2011, having previously worked for PayPal helping run eBay Marketplace in Germany and in other European markets. I'd also worked at media companies RTL(Opens in a new window) and Bertelsmann(Opens in a new window), and at smaller startups as well. What excited me about working at SoundCloud was the opportunity to build on my previous career in media and enable new technologies. SoundCloud brings both [media and tech] together.

A global product... SoundCloud is one of the few truly global startups. We often note that ""global is on our DNA."" We currently have more than 200 employees worldwide (with over 150 of those in Berlin) representing 31 different nationalities, and our product has been designed at a global level since the beginning. It works for anyone, anywhere in the world.

Zeroing in on creators... Recently, we've been concentrating on finding new ways for our creator community to be discovered and heard. Recent updates to both our web platform and mobile applications have made SoundCloud more social than ever before, with the addition of new features focused on improving discovery, sharing and connectivity between community members. Our creator community has been scaling at a rapid rate. We see creation happening every day, with 12 hours of music and audio posted every minute.

Today, SoundCloud has 200 employees.

Organic growth... I started at Gilt as a merchandising intern right out of school five years ago. Since then, I've had roles in buying for our home, kids, women's jewelry and beauty categories, and also in supervising sales and creative operations. Currently, I'm director of business process strategy, where I work across all of Gilt to improve our processes, tools and resourcing, all of which continue to help us scale. As new projects come up, Gilt gives me the opportunity to take the lead because I've learned from early on the way the company operates and how teams collaborate. These opportunities have come about very organically because I've been able to grow along with Gilt.

Sticking with its core... When I started at Gilt, it was at time when the company was growing quickly, expanding into new verticals and launching our Japanese office. We were building an innovative company to become a leader in the flash-sale space. Today, five years later, we continue to focus on what makes us uniquely Gilt: Our core flash-sale business. We're always coming up with new ideas and new ways to do things, though -- whether that means launching personalized sales generated by algorithms and based on your shopping behavior or creating new mobile app features that make it even easier and faster to shop Gilt.

Keeping the challenge strong... There's always a new challenge. Every day at noon, we launch an entirely new store. As a result, every day at Gilt is different. It keeps the work really interesting for the team since there is always another exciting project to work on or a new, challenging problem to solve.

Today, Gilt has more than 1,000 employees.

110% music... Before I joined VEVO, part of my routine every morning would be to check VEVO's website. I loved seeing all the new video premieres, the crisp player and what they were doing with original programming. I was working at AOL, and while I really enjoyed it there, I was excited to be part of something fresh and new. I was also thrilled that my focus would be 110% on music.

New responsibilities... I was hired as a supervising producer for our performance-based original content. Over the past year, I've had the opportunity to work closely with our event marketing team and have since taken on a significant part of the production and planning of our events. Live performance events and marketing events are very similar and have a lot of crossover. However, I'm also very lucky that I've been given the chance to refine my skills as an event producer and take on new responsibilities.

Sweet perks... VEVO is a fantastic place to work -- artists often come by to play a new album or perform a new single and they bring lunch. Getting to meet unbelievably talented people (John Legend, Ellie Goulding, Thirty Seconds to Mars -- not to name drop) certainly doesn't hurt.

This ancient scientific fact has been the center of a recent 21st century debate. Robert Sungenis, a filmmaker who also denies the Holocaust(Opens in a new window), has created a documentary called The Principle that sets out to prove that geocentrism is real.

You may notice a familiar voice from that trailer: Kate Mulgrew. But your favorite Star Trek and Orange is the New Black actress isn't coming out in favor of the theory.

Though it's unclear what she thought ""Everything you think you know about the universe is wrong"" meant.

One of the physicists featured in the trailer has also disavowed the project. Lawrence Krauss of Arizona State University claimed that he never knowingly did an interview for the documentary and his segments were cut and pasted and taken out of context.

For all who asked: Some clips of me apparently were mined for movie on geocentricism. So stupid does disservice to word nonsense. Ignore it.â€” Lawrence Krauss (@LKrauss1) April 8, 2014(Opens in a new window)

In a piece for Slate(Opens in a new window) titled ""I Have No Idea How I Ended up in That Stupid Geocentrism Documentary,"" Krauss implores readers to forget about the documetary and the whole incident, saying that, ""Maybe then it will quickly disappear into the dustbin of history, where it belongs.""

After his departure, all of Apple's software design will report to senior vice-president Jony Ive, who Christie reportedly had problems with.

[seealso slug=""ios-7-hidden-features""]

Citing ""sources briefed on the matter,"" 9to5Mac(Opens in a new window) reported Christie -- who currently leads software design for iOS -- will leave Apple ""soon."" Ive became the head of human interface design in 2012 following the departure of iOS chief Scott Forstall, but Christie and his team still reported to senior vice-president of software engineering Craig Federighi. When Christie departs, all software designers will report to Ive, the report said.

Apple recently raised Christie's profile by having him grant interviews with the Wall Street Journal(Opens in a new window) and NPR(Opens in a new window) on the iPhone's creation, ostensibly as ammunition in its current legal battles with Samsung over patent infringement. That makes the timing of his departure curious, and lends support to the theory of a falling out with Ive.

Apple is expected to unveil new software for its mobile and desktop platforms, iOS 8 and OS X 10.10, at its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) on June 2. The report said the new version of OS X would follow the aesthetic of iOS 7, elevating flat design in place of textures -- something Christie was instrumental in implementing in earlier versions of iOS and OS X.

7008574,The Heartbleed Hit List: The Passwords You Need to Change Right Now,"An encryption flaw called the Heartbleed bug is already being dubbed one of the biggest security threats the Internet has ever seen. The bug has affected many popular websites and services -- ones you might use every day, like Gmail and Facebook -- and could have quietly exposed your sensitive account information (such as passwords and credit card numbers) over the past two years.

But it hasn't always been clear which sites have been affected. Mashable reached out to some of the most popular social, email, banking and commerce sites on the web. We've rounded up their responses below.

SEE ALSO: How to Protect Yourself From the Heartbleed Bug

Some Internet companies that were vulnerable to the bug have already updated their servers with a security patch to fix the issue. This means you'll need to go in and change your passwords immediately for these sites. Even that is no guarantee that your information wasn't already compromised, but there's also no indication that hackers knew about the exploit before this week. The companies that are advising customers to change their passwords are doing so as a precautionary measure.

Although changing your password regularly is always good practice, if a site or service hasn't yet patched the problem, your information will still be vulnerable.

Also, if you reused the same password on multiple sites, and one of those sites was vulnerable, you'll need to change the password everywhere. It's not a good idea to use the same password across multiple sites, anyway.

We'll keep updating the list as new information comes in. Last update: April 19, 11:00 a.m. ET

7028481,Why Heartbleed Is the Ultimate Web Nightmare,"It's easy to want to think the reaction to the Heartbleed OpenSSL vulnerability is overblown; Sadly, it's not. Heartbleed is bad. It's not hyperbole; it's a major problem.

In fact, Heartbleed has the potential to be one of the biggest, most widespread vulnerabilities in the history of the modern web. Frustratingly, however, because the problem is technical -- very technical -- it's difficult for regular users to understand why this vulnerability is a big deal, what services have been vulnerable in the past and what services remain vulnerable now.

Even worse, the technical nature of Heartbleed means that as an end user, you are limited in how to protect yourself. The onus is on the person who manages the web service -- or who manages the back-end service the web service uses -- not the end user.

Writing about Heartbleed, security expert Bruce Schneier says(Opens in a new window) ""'catastrophic' is the right word. On the scale of 1 to 10, this is an 11."" That's about right.

So why is Heartbleed so bad? Why is this such a big deal?

Geeksplaining OpenSSL

At the root of Heartbleed is encryption. The idea of encryption to make sure the information you send from your computer to someone else (or to another web server) is protected and secure. The larger conversation surrounding the need for encryption has increased since last summer's NSA revelations.

As an Internet-using populous, we're more aware than ever of the importance of keeping private and confidential information ""secure.""

Think of encryption like a secret language between two people. The two of us are the only people that know the language; to everyone else, what we're saying sounds like gibberish. In encryption terms, this language works as a set of encryption keys.

The user (that's you) has a copy of the encryption keys on their computer and the client (that's the web app or server) has a set. Obviously, it's super-important to keep those keys secure.

The Internet has a set of protocols(Opens in a new window) for handling security, commonly referred to as Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and its successor Transport Layer Security (TLS). SSL/TLS is a major part of how the modern web works.

And like a lot of other web protocols, there are various out-of-the-box solutions for providing SSL/TLS functionality to a website or app. The most common implementation is set of open-source tools known as OpenSSL. OpenSSL is free -- which is always good -- and it was designed in such a way that can be used in lots of different types of projects.

Tons of major web services and web apps OpenSSL as a way to provide SSL/TLS functionality. Out of the box, OpenSSL is included with lots of versions of Linux, including Debian, Suse, Red Hat and Ubuntu. Two of the most popular projects for acting as web servers, Apache and Nginx, use OpenSSL.

It's not just apps and services that control web pages. Lots of email services, instant messaging clients, network routers and even printers can use OpenSSL.

OpenSSL runs on 66% of the web. Even if you don't ever see OpenSSL or know what it stands for, chances are, you interact with it several times a day. That interaction can be as simple as entering in a password for an email account or as complex as sending a private message or photo or even filing your taxes.

Why Heartbleed is so scary

Okay, so OpenSSL is a major part of the modern Internet. What would happen if OpenSSL had a flaw? What if that flaw meant those secret keys between you and the server were suddenly accessible by someone else?

What if the flaw meant that someone could secretly gain access to the keys the server has, make a copy for themselves, and eavesdrop on everything you say to that server? What if that flaw was impossible to detect?

That's Heartbleed. It's a vulnerability that, thus far, has operated without detection. Plus, it's designed in such a way that with enough effort and enough time, lots of information could be accessed by someone else. And you (and the server you talk to) would have no idea.

As bad as that is, the worst part is that this vulnerability has actually been around since December 2011. Lots of software packages started using the vulnerable version of OpenSSL in May 2012. So for two years, any app, website, bank or private messaging app that uses OpenSSL has been vulnerable to this bug.

Now, it's important to note that not every web server or application uses OpenSSL as its SSL/TLS implementation. It's also true that if an app was using something older than OpenSSL circa 2011, this bug won't effect it. As we've seen, however, the vast, vast majority of OpenSSL implementations running on the web before Monday were running a version vulnerable to Heartbleed.

Fixing the Problem is not that simple

A patch that fixes the Heartbleed vulnerability in OpenSSL is already widely available. Every major Linux distribution has issued patches, major web and cloud hosts such as Heroku, Cloudflare, Amazon and others have patched their own servers and fortunately, this is an international story.

The patch itself isn't that difficult to implement, but the problem is that along with patching the software, some applications need to look at whether or not they need to revoke and reissue various digital certificates. A digital certificate is most commonly used by a web browser to validate that a web server is secure. The website applies for a certificate with a certification authority (CA) as away to prove it is who it says it is. This certificate shows that website X is connected with a specific name, email and DNS address, which helps ""prove"" its identity. Codenomicon, the security firm that along with Google's Neel Mehta discovered Heartbleed, found that it was able to use the vulnerability to steal the secret keys attached to its own X.509 digital certificates. X.509 is an extremely common cryptographic protocol for digital certificates.

Codenomicon's discovery means that It's possible that any certificate issued before the Heartbleed vulnerability was patched could still be compromised. If someone was able to sneak in an grab a site's digital certificate before the site was patched, it could make changes to the certificate or masquerade another site as having a different identity.

Organizations have to make the determination whether to revoke and reissue all certificates via a CA or wait for current certificates to expire. It's not trivial to just revoke and reissue a bunch of SSL certificates, it takes time. With the number of potential certificates that need to be revoked or reissued, it could take days or weeks for every CA to catch-up for every service. If the certificates were issued when the site was still vulnerable

There's nothing you can do about the past

In the wake of the Heartbleed disclosure, system administrators have been scurrying to secure their systems, revoke certificates, check for other patches and change login data.

What these admins cannot do, however, is go back in time and prevent any person (or organization) who may have taken advantage of this vulnerability to access information not intended for them.

Even scarier, it's not even clear that it's possible to tell if anyone bypassed the vulnerability in the past. In other words -- patching a system today is great -- but that can't prevent any silent destruction that has already happened.

This thing has legs

As Jason Lefkowitz(Opens in a new window) points out, the most jarring aspect of this entire bug is that it has lots and lots of potential vectors.

For instance, we all know that at least for a time, Yahoo! Mail was vulnerable. That means that if you used your Yahoo! Mail password for any other site between Dec. 2011 and now, that password also needs to be changed.

Most of us use the same password, or a set of passwords, rather than using a unique password for every login. I'm a huge proponent of password managers and I still find myself using the same three or four passwords all too often. Most of the time its trivial (I use a unique password for every email, bank and major social media account), but discrepancies do happen.

So not only is every password you've used at a vulnerable site at risk -- the bigger problem is that although major vendors and websites are scurrying to fix this problem now, smaller apps and sites might take more time. Or worse, they might ignore the problem altogether.

It's easy to check to see if your email provider or bank has updated its security to protect against Heartbleed, but what about a local restaurant? Your doctor's office? A company you used once to get a ride to the airport? A boutique hotel you booked online directly through their website? You might be surprised (and scared) to realize how many places have your information -- and how poor their security practices might be.

What Next?

Before rushing into changing all of your passwords, it's worth waiting to make sure that each service you use has patched its servers. That way, you don't have to change things twice.

Other than that, Heartbleed is just a scary example of what can go wrong when software we all rely on turns out to be unsafe.

The existence of Heartbleed has no big takeaways or ""lessons for next time."" This is just a bad situation with no winners and millions of losers.

7028415,"Your Heartbleed Bug Questions, Answered","Multiple popular websites were exposed to a major Internet bug called Heartbleed earlier this week. The bug was discovered by a member of Google's security team and the software security firm Codenomicon.

Heartbleed is a serious security threat that has the potential to expose users' private information, including passwords, financial details and instant messages, among other things.

SEE ALSO: How to Protect Yourself From the Heartbleed Bug

To help you understand the bug and what you should be doing to protect your information, Mashable editor-at-large Lance Ulanoff answered user questions on our Facebook page(Opens in a new window). Here are highlights from the chat:

What is Heartbleed?

Heartbleed is a bug in the code running on the servers of millions of websites. It leaves open a hole that allows hackers to get in and around the encryption between you and the site. This means that the information stored on the servers, and passed between you, could be stolen.

Is this strictly a threat that is only on the Internet?

Just the Internet: Sites running OpenSSL.

Is Heartbleed a virus?

Not exactly. It is a hole that could leave websites and user information open to attack.

Why wasn't it discovered until now?

The code error was small. It was not an attack; it was simply some bad code written by the people who built OpenSSL. It sounds like more of an accident.

Has a list of the major sites using OpenSSL been compiled?

There are millions of sites that use OpenSSL, so a full list might not be that easy to peruse. LastPass unveiled a tool(Opens in a new window) to help you search for specific websites to find out if there are issues. [Update: We've compiled a list of popular sites and whether they were affected.]

When should we change our passwords?

Changing passwords right now might be a pointless exercise. The sites you visit could still have the vulnerability and your new password could be stolen.

If I'm running my own website, how do I protect it?

If you run OpenSSL, update it as soon as possible.

Has it affected most firewalls?

It's not really a firewall attack. If the vulnerability exists (on a site or service), the communication between you and it is open to compromise.

How safe is the Internet anymore?

It's pretty safe.

Do you think the latest bug was somehow related to the NSA?

No.

6870627,How to Protect Yourself From the Heartbleed Bug,"An encryption flaw called the Heartbleed bug that has exposed a collection of popular websites -- from Airbnb and Yahoo to NASA and OKCupid -- could be one of the biggest security threats the Internet has ever seen. If you have logged into any of the affected sites over the past two years, your account information could be compromised, allowing cybercriminals to snap up your credit card information or steal your passwords.

You're likely affected either directly or indirectly by the bug, which was found by a member of Google's security team and a software firm named Codenomicon(Opens in a new window). The bad news: There's not a lot you can do about it now. It's the responsibility of Internet companies to update their servers to deal with Heartbleed, and once they do, you can take action (see below).

The issue involves network software called OpenSSL, which is an open-source set of libraries for encrypting online services. Secure websites -- with â€œhttpsâ€ in the URL (""s"" stands for secure) -- make up 56% of websites, and nearly half of those sites were vulnerable to the bug. In theory, a cybercriminal could have exploited Heartbleed by making network requests that could piece together your sensitive data. The good news: There isn't any indication that a hacker caught wind of this; it seems the researchers were the first to locate the problem.

But the scary part is that attackers could have infiltrated these websites, extracted the information they wanted and left no trace of their presence. Thus, it's hard to determine whether someone ever exploited the bug, or if your account information was compromised.

What to do

First, check which sites you use are affected. If you don't want to read through the long list of websites with the security flaw(Opens in a new window), the password security firm LastPass has set up a Heartbleed Checker(Opens in a new window), which lets you enter the URL of any website to check its vulnerability to the bug and if the site has issued a patch. [Update: We've compiled a list of popular sites and whether they were affected.]

Next, change your passwords for major accounts -- email, banking and social media logins -- on sites that were affected by Heartbleed but patched the problem. That patch should also include reissuing any digital certificates(Opens in a new window) that might be vulnerable. However, if the site or service hasn't patched the flaw yet, there's no point to changing your password. Instead, ask the company when it expects to push out a fix to deal with Heartbleed.

A big cause for concern is related to sites that have your sensitive information, such as Yahoo and OKCupid (most people aren't logging into NASA.gov with private data). Both companies have since issued a patch to fix the security hole, so users with accounts with those companies -- including Yahoo Mail, Flickr and so on -- should update their passwords immediately.

It's important to wait to get the ""all clear"" sign from a company or service before changing, especially now that this bug is out in the open. Changing a password before the bug is fully patched wont' make things any better.

Facebook and Twitter use OpenSSL web servers, though it's still unclear whether or not they were vulnerable to the issue. Facebook reportedly issued a security patch, as did Google(Opens in a new window).

Other websites that have issued an OpenSSL software security update include WordPress, Amazon Web Services and Akamai.

Some websites not considered vulnerable include AOL, Foursquare and Evernote, among others.

""It's a big deal for Internet users, especially when it comes to protecting financial information,"" Joe Siegrist, CEO and cofounder of LastPass, told Mashable. ""Some financial organizations are using more conservative web security choices like Microsoft, which is not vulnerable to the bug, so users should check and see if their bank has been affected.""

Make sure to keep an eye on sensitive online accounts, especially banking and email, for suspicious activity for the next week or so.

Twenty people were injured Wednesday morning in a stabbing at a high school near Pittsburgh. A male suspect, reported to be in 10th grade, is in custody. Police have no known motive as of this time.

Twi victims from Franklin Regional High School in Murrysville, Pa., remain in critical condition(Opens in a new window), according to officials. A doctor at Forbes Regional Hospital, which was reportedly treating seven students, said(Opens in a new window) the students had critical injuries, but all are expected to survive.

The victims range from age 15 to 60 years old, and most of their wounds were to the lower abdomen. The majority of the students were hurt as the suspect ran down a hallway flashing two large, 8 to 10-inch knives, officials say.

The attack was stopped when he was tackled(Opens in a new window) by the school's assistant principal Sam King. ""I'd expect nothing less from him....It feels good to know my dad saved the day,"" his son said(Opens in a new window).

Students who witnessed the stabbing described a chaotic and bloody scene.

""It was really fast. It felt like he hit me with a wet rag because I felt the blood splash on my face. It spurted up on my forehead,"" victim Nate Moore, 15, told the AP. The attacker ""had the same expression on his face that he has every day, which was the freakiest part,"" Moore said(Opens in a new window). ""He wasn't saying anything. He didn't have any anger on his face. It was just a blank expression.""

""I was walking into the school and a stampede of people were running after me,"" a student who witnessed the stabbing told NBC News(Opens in a new window). ""They were screaming, 'Go to your cars! Go to your cars! Someone is stabbing people!'""

â€œIn a situation like this, you want the students to run,â€ Murrysville Police Chief Thomas Seefeld said, noting that they did the right thing.

One alleged victim(Opens in a new window) of the attack posted a selfie to Instagram, showing a wound on his right arm.

â€œI was shocked and saddened upon learning of the events that occurred this morning as students arrived at Franklin Regional High School. As a parent and grandparent, I can think of nothing more distressing than senseless violence against children. My heart and prayers go out to all the victims and their families,â€ Pennsylvania Governor Tom Corbett said in a statement.

Three helicopters and dozens of ambulances had been dispatched to Franklin Regional High School, CBS News reported(Opens in a new window), after the stabbing occurred in hallways and multiple classrooms in the buildingâ€™s science wing shortly before 7:30 a.m. ET.

In preparation for the New York International Auto Show next week, Land Rover has unveiled its new concept technology, Transparent Bonnet. ""Bonnet"" refers to the hood of the concept SUV, which is not transparent at all, but appears that way in a nifty blend of virtual reality and crafty camera placement.

[seealso slug=""corvette-stingray-car-of-the-year""]

During the demonstration, which you can watch in the video above, Land Rover equipped one of its new SUVs with wide-angle camera situated in the car's grill. The camera view starts almost where the driver's ends, and extends from directly in front of and below the grill, all the way under the engine and between the front two wheels. But that's not the amazing part.

The car is also equipped with a heads-up display which projects car data like speed and clearance onto the windshield. The new Transparent Bonnet technology also lets it project the camera's view onto the windshield. It's perfectly positioned, at least in the video, so it looks as though the car hood has suddenly become semi-transparent. Essentially, the driver sees not only the road below, but also the orientation of the car's front wheels.

According to Land Rover, this new view could help drivers climb ""a steep incline"" or maneuver ""in a confined space.""

For now, Transparent Bonnet is still just a concept; Land Rover offers no details on retail availability.

7008454,Officials: We'll Find Missing Plane in the 'Not Too Distant Future',"Underwater search teams in the Indian Ocean have picked up two fresh signals that they hope are from the black boxes that were on board the missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370.

The searchers have now found four signals total -- all within 17 miles of each other. Authorities are almost certain this could be their big break.

""I'm now optimistic. We'll find the aircraft or what's left of the aircraft in the not too distant future,"" Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston said Wednesday.

With a pinger locator in tow, Australian ship Ocean Shield first detected signals over the weekend that were consistent with those from a flight data recorder and a cockpit voice recorder. At the time, authorities said it was their ""most promising lead."" But after they lost the signals, it was nothing but silence for three days. It seemed they'd hit another brick wall.

Then, two new pings. The first signal lasted 5 minutes, 32 seconds; the second was 7 minutes.

These new signals are in the within the confines of a small search area that's about 1,100 miles from Perth.

""I believe we are searching in the right area, but we need to visually identify wreckage before we can confirm with certainty that this is the final resting place of MH370,"" Houston said in a news conference.

After chasing down several dead-end leads over the past month, authorities approached the first rounds of signals with skepticism because marine life can sometimes emit similar sounds. However, experts analyzed the first two signals and determined that they were, in fact, from a manmade device and not nature.

Up to 11 military aircraft, four civil aircraft and 14 ships are assisting in Wednesday's search. The underwater search is also in progress, with Ocean Shield at the northern end of the search area and HMS Echo and Chinese ship Haixun 01 to the south.

If teams recover the plane's black boxes, it will be nothing short of a miracle. Batteries in the flight recorders last only 30 days. As of Wednesday, the plane has been missing for 33 days.

If the signals disappear before officials locate the flight recorders, we may never know what happened to MH370.

That question was answered Monday when Micro, a $299 3D printer, hit its Kickstarter funding goal of $50,000 in mere 11 minutes and continued to raise $1.46 million less than two full days after the campaign started.

Its creator, a Bethesda, Md. company called M3D, calls the Micro(Opens in a new window) the ""most affordable 3D printer that can be used right out of the box.""

The Micro is a cube-shaped device, 7.3-inch wide and weighing roughly 2.2 lbs. It works with Windows, Mac and Linux, has a USB-compatible connection, and supports a number of different materials, including ABS, PLA and Nylon.

Its most important feature, however, is the price -- $299 is pretty cheap when compared to most alternatives on the market. For comparison, Makerbot's Replicator Mini(Opens in a new window), another compact 3D printer, costs $1,375.

User-generated content (UGC) is media created by your peers. It includes status updates, blog posts and restaurant reviews -- any content from non-professionals without any real motivation besides adding an opinion to the sea of already existing opinions. In a more logical world, it isn't the type of content we'd trust over a professional's review.

Ipsos' study, however, reveals that millennials trust UGC just as much as professional reviews. UGC is also 20% more influential when it comes to purchasing and 35% more memorable than other types of media. You can chalk that up to the fact that millennials spend five hours per day with UGC.

The gender gap in American leadership is abysmal, diversity(Opens in a new window) breeds better ideas -- you know all of this. But as you also know, executives like seeing the numbers when it comes to their business decisions.

Luckily, weâ€™ve found the stats to prove once and for all why itâ€™s really worth hiring more women.

The Anita Borg Institute for Women and Technology, a nonprofit that seeks to help women advance in the field of technology, recently published a new paper called The Case for Investing in Women(Opens in a new window) detailing the huge difference that women make in the workforce, especially when theyâ€™re in leadership or senior roles.

What makes this paper so important compared to the piles of academic research done on the importance of women in the workforce(Opens in a new window)? ABIâ€™s paper is the first comprehensive paper that summarizes studies from across different academic disciplines, meaning that CEOs and other people in power donâ€™t have to spend hours digging through thousands of pages of research to see the facts straight.

So, what are some of these mind-boggling findings from the report? Here are a few banner observations:

An economist from Carnegie Mellon found that teams that included at least one female member had a collectively higher IQ than teams that had just men.

When Fortune 500 companies had at least three female directors, several key factors increased: The return on invested capital jumped over 66%, return on sales went up 42%, and return on equity increased by 53%.

Gallup found that companies with more diversity on staff have a 22% lower turnover rate, and if an organization has a more inclusive culture that embraces women, itâ€™s easier to recruit a more diverse staff.

A 2012 study on womenâ€™s participation in IT patents found that patents with mixed gender teams were cited 30% to 40% more than similar patents with all-male teams.

Studies in 17 different countries in all different industries found that across the board, having a larger number of women on a team accounts for greater psychological safety, team confidence, group experimentation, and team efficiency.

Overall, the reason why the data matters is simple: More diversity leads to more creative products(Opens in a new window) and teams, which leads to better businesses. Jeanne Hultquist, author of the paper, explains: â€œ[With] more diverse team chemistry, you get more perspectives(Opens in a new window) with a larger variety of options to consider, and more chances of having innovative solutions proposed.â€ And women are a serious driver of this diversity.",4/9/2014 0:00,0.561927,5,2,0,4.820862,6,Business,1855.919,3951.833,2861.339,867,0.443082,0.165337,0.054422,0.013605,0,0,1200

By ""this"" we mean the Nicolas Cage Art Party, a celebration of Cage-themed artwork -- some of it quite well done -- that will pay homage to the delightfully dreadful actor much of the Internet loves to hate when not hating itself for loving him.

[seealso url = ""http://mashable.com/2014/03/08/best-apps-for-toilet""]

That's right: A Cage-themed art show, believed to be the world's first, is real and coming to San Francisco, Calif. Then it will mosey south for an encore in Los Angeles in July. More than a thousand people have already RSVP'd on Facebook(Opens in a new window) to the San Francisco event, which starts at 7 p.m. on April 12 at a nightclub called BalanÃ§oire in the city's trendy Mission District.

Because, after all, doesn't a man who's capable of producing cinema like, well, this deserve such a fÃªte?

The Nicolas Cage Art Party(Opens in a new window) (alternately called the Nicolas Cage Art Show and Musical Shenanigans) is the brainchild of Ezra Croft. Croft is 35 years old, a Burning Man veteran, an avid cyclist and a Bay Area DJ who works at Bed Bath & Beyond to pay the bills. He was working an overnight shift at BB&B one night and looking at Reddit -- where the One True God(Opens in a new window) subreddit extolls the virtues of all things Cage -- when the concept crept into his brain.

""It didn't start out as a joke,"" Croft says, before adding with a laugh: ""But it didn't start out not as a joke, either.""

After conceptualizing the idea and seeing it through, Croft began putting up calls for submissions on Craigslist boards all over the world. Submissions have since poured in from points across globe -- France, Nigeria and Japan, for example.

We should all be grateful for Croft's joke-not-joke though, because without it we wouldn't have pieces like this:

About 90 pieces in total, representing a vast range of styles, will be on display at Saturday's show, including this one depicting Cage as hero Cameron Poe in the timeless 1997 classic Con Air.

So why Cage? Croft says the Internet's strange obsession with him was the clincher -- plus, he says, ""the whole Grumpy Cat art thing kind of came and went.""

But Croft also adds that there's something a little more serious behind the show -- the idea of taking something as fatuous as an Internet meme and using it to inspire real art.

Some of the submissions have come from what Croft calls ""insanely talented"" artists. ""Then you have the fact that it's Nicolas Cage,"" he says. ""It's like cat videos directed by Martin Scorsese.""

Scorsese may be a stretch, but Croft isn't lying about the talent some of these folks possess. To wit:

There will plenty more than just creepily well-done paintings of Nicolas Cage to titillate the senses on Saturday, too.

Croft promises a range of musical acts, including one that comes with an interpretive dancer named ""Beany."" Beany, it should be added, is a bearded man who weighs 300 pounds.

As the Cage festival picked up steam, Croft decided to expand it to L.A. in the summer. But something bigger -- ""even more grandiose,"" Croft says -- is coming later this year: a Bill Murray-themed art exhibition that will make a four-city tour through San Francisco, L.A., Seattle and New York.

Why? ""Because Bill Murray,"" Croft explains.

7008322,Omada Health Raises $23 Million to Help Prevent Chronic Diseases Online,"[wp_scm_launchpad]

It's not every week that you see a tech founder who has worked as an analytics associate at Google and as a nurse assistant at a hospital. Sean Duffy has always straddled these two worlds: his mother was a nurse and he developed a fascination for medicine, but he never could shake the fact that he was ""huge tech geek.""

""I was always kind of torn between tech and medicine,"" Duffy says. In 2011, he found a way to blend these two passions together with Omada Health, a digital healthcare startup that takes a multi-pronged approach to help prevent chronic diseases.

For the startup's first act, it focused on diabetes, or more accurately prediabetes, meaning people who have higher-than-normal blood sugar and are at risk of type 2 diabetes as well as heart disease and strokes. One third of U.S. adults were prediabetic in 2010, according to the CDC(Opens in a new window). Most are not aware of it.

Omada's team, which includes former employees from Google, Amazon and IDEO, crafted a 16-week program called Prevent, based on the major government-sponsored Diabetes Prevention Program(Opens in a new window) except with more digital tools. Participants join small online groups of their peers, receive coaching from health professionals and track their progress using a pedometer and wireless scale that are supplied. The goal is to get people to lose weight in and change their behaviors.

On Wednesday, Omada announced raising a $23 million Series B round of funding led by Andressen Horowitz to expand on this diabetes prevention initiative and begin working on similar efforts for other diseases.

The areas the startup is exploring, according to Duffy, are ""conditions you can make better through weight loss and lifestyle change."" As of right now, Omada is looking into ways to prevent hyper-tension, high cholesterol, smoking cessation and lower back pain.

The funding is also notable for Andreessen Horowitz as it represents the prominent VC firm's first significant investment in the healthcare and biomedical space.

""If we can prove out that diabetes prevention works at scale then maybe we can get into smoking cessation or other chronic behaviors,"" Balaji Srinivasan, a general partner at Andreessen, who will join Omada's board of directors.

7028149,Tearful Olympic Hero Oscar Pistorius Describes Killing Girlfriend,"Between sobs and howls, South African Olympic hero Oscar Pistorius took the witness stand at his own murder trial on Tuesday to finally describe the night he killed his model girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp last year.

Pistorius' account of the events of the wee hours of Valentine's Day 2013 marked his first extended public comments on the killing. It was the dramatic high point of a trial that has gripped South Africa for over a year, and has already included no shortage of macabre, startling moments.

[seealso url = ""http://mashable.com/2014/03/13/oscar-pistorius-trial""]

Pistorius surged to worldwide fame at the 2012 Summer Olympics after becoming the first amputee sprinter to compete in the both the Paralympics and Olympics. He netted lucrative endorsement deals from Nike and others while becoming a global inspiration for overcoming the amputation of both his lower legs to find athletic success.

Then, just seven months later, he was arrested for Steenkamp's killing, and charged with premeditated murder by South African prosecutors. Arguments in his trial began on March 3 of this year, and Pistorius first took the stand on Monday, before going into more detail about Steenkamp's death on Tuesday.

On Tuesday, Pistorius told Judge Thokozile Masipa -- who will decide his fate alone because South Africa has no jury trials -- that he struggled to sleep and awoke during the pre-dawn hours of Valentine's Day 2013, according to the Associated Press(Opens in a new window). He said he stepped onto a balcony of a bedroom he shared with Steenkamp in his well-appointed home in a gated community in Pretoria, South Africa, to get some fresh air. Pistorius said he returned to the dark bedroom, then heard a noise come from its bathroom.

Pistorius told Masipa and her Pretoria courtroom that he felt vulnerable there in the dark, walking only on the stumps of his amputated legs. Fearing a home-invasion robbery, he said he yelled for Steenkamp to call the police. Then, he said he heard a door slam, and took that as final proof that his home was being invaded. So he fired four shots from a pistol through the locked bathroom door, thinking an intruder was inside.

Only later -- after calling Steenkamp's name more and searching for her in possible hiding spots -- did he realize the mistake he could have made, Pistorius said. He broke down the bathroom door to find Steenkamp's bloodied body.

""I sat over Reeva, and I cried,"" Pistorius said, according to the AP. ""I don't know how long I was there for.""

So the public has finally heard Pistorius' account of that night in his own words. But the trial's central question still remains: Is Pistorius himself the victim of a tragic misunderstanding, living with torment and guilt after accidentally shooting to death the beloved girlfriend he assumed in a panic was a malicious intruder? Or is that all a lie, as the prosecution alleges, concocted to conceal the truth -- that Pistorius murdered Steenkamp after a lover's quarrel?

The fallen hero

Whatever the answer to that question, Pistorius' shocking change of fate has cast the man once exalted as a hero in an ugly new light, and his trial offers a window into larger racial and gender-based issues South Africa has struggled with for decades.

As Pistorius attained fame in South Africa after first winning a Paralympic gold medal at 17 years old in 2004, he was given the nickname ""Blade Runner"" for the high-tech prosthetics that let him run. He was allowed to compete in the 2012 Olympics only after winning a drawn-out legal battle against the International Association of Athletic Federations, and then carried the South African flag at the London games' closing ceremony.

But Pistorius was more than just a heartwarming story in his home country. For many, he was an icon who transcended sports. Some even found his triumph over enormous adversity to find success on the greatest stage analogous to South Africa's journey as a country after decades of apartheid separated black and white citizens.

Simon Hartley, managing editor of the the South African news site 2oceansvibe(Opens in a new window), told Mashable last month that many saw Pistorius in this light ""because being able to sprint after being born without functional legs is something we need to believe we're able to do, if we're going to become a country in which no one ever feels marginalized ever again.""

But if Pistorius came to represent the best of South Africa, his murder trial also magnifies some of its worst.

The country has one of the world's highest rates of violence against women, and many see Pistorius' killing of Steenkamp as a tabloid-ready instance of something that's all too common. The murder of women by men close to them, called ""intimate femicide,"" is considered a problem unto its own.

And the very basis of Pistorius' legal defense is tinged with racial implications in a country just 20 years removed from apartheid and its first democratic election, according to some.

Violent home robberies against the affluent are feared by many in South Africa. Pistorius' argument that he killed Steenkamp by accident while scared for his own safety plays to the worries of many -- largely white -- South Africans.

But according to South African novelist Margie Orford, that narrative contains some measure of race-based fear mongering. Pistorius' defense, Orford wrote in The Guardian(Opens in a new window) last month, ""inserts a third body into an all too familiar narrative of domestic violence ... It is the threatening body, nameless and faceless, of an armed and dangerous black intruder.""

What to expect from a cross-examination

Oscar Pistorius weeps as he listens to evidence by a pathologist in court in Pretoria, South Africa, Monday, April 7, 2014. Credit: Themba Hadebe, Pool

And that brings us back to Tuesday's tearful testimony. Did Pistorius shoot Steenkamp after mistaking her for an intruder? Or was something more sinister at play?

At one point on Tuesday, Pistorius left the courtroom to change from his suit into a shirt and shorts, according to courtroom reports. Then, in clothing similar to what he wore the night he killed Steenkamp, Pistorius removed his prosthetic lower legs. He stood before the court on his stumps next to the very bullet-scarred door through which he shot Steenkamp. Most observers thought this move was designed by Pistorius' high-priced legal team to engender sympathy for how vulnerable Pistorius could have felt thinking an intruder was in his bedroom.

Then Pistorius told Masipa and her full courtroom about how he thought he heard a noise made by an intruder, describing that as ""the moment that everything changed.""

Pistorius has wept, sobbed, retched or vomited in court multiple times since his trial began on March 3, but none of those occasions match the outbursts that came from him on the witness stand Tuesday, according to courtroom reports. Different news reports describe his apparently tortured utterances as ""wails"" and ""howls."" Masipa soon ended the day's proceedings.

With the prosecution having wrapped its case in late March and Pistorius now having taken the stand, most remaining questions about the trial concern the prosecution's expected cross-examination of Pistorius. That will likely come later this week, providing more dramatic courtroom moments. The cross-examination will give state prosecution a chance to poke holes in Pistorius' account of Valentine's Day 2013, as well as allow it to continue pointing to evidence it says proves Pistorius has a history of fascination with firearms and volatile relationships with women.

But even if Masipa does believe Pistorius' account of the killing, that may not save the man once known as ""Blade Runner"" from a murder conviction, according to William Booth, a Cape Town, South Africa, attorney who specializes in criminal cases.

""He exceeded the bounds of what he was entitled to in our law, and even if he didn't think it was Reeva, he could still be guilty of murder,"" Booth told NBC(Opens in a new window).

If convicted of premeditated murder, Pistorius faces a sentence of life in prison, without possibility of parole for at least 25 years. If found not guilty, Pistorius could still be found guilty of culpable homicide, a charge comparable to manslaughter in the United States. That charge could carry a sentence of up to 15 years, according to CNN(Opens in a new window). And then there's always the possibility of him escaping prison altogether.

Exactly when that judgement is handed down is unclear. But, with the bulk of Pistorius' testimony likely behind us, the much-anticipated moment of truth marches ever nearer.

UPDATE, April 9, 10:11 a.m.: Prosecutor Gerrie Nel began cross-examining Pistorius on Wednesday, accusing the athlete of killing his girlfriend on purpose.

""You made a mistake?"" he told Pistorius, trying to rattle him, according to CNN(Opens in a new window). ""You shot and killed her. Say it -- 'I shot and killed Reeva Steenkamp.""

Nel, whom The New York Times(Opens in a new window) describes as ""combative, dogged and pugnacious"" -- he's known as ""the pit bull"" -- even took out a graphic picture of Steenkamp's head after the shooting, pushing Pistorius to look at it.

""Take responsibility for what youâ€™ve done!"" he said, according to The Times.

Pistorius refused, saying he remembered that image. ""I was there,"" he said, adding that the memory tormented him. At that point Pistorius started weeping, and the court took a recess to give him time to compose himself.

The paralympic athlete defended himself saying he did not intend to kill Steenkamp, ""or anybody else for that matter.""

""I had a fear, I didn't have time to think, I discharged my firearm,"" he said. ""I didn't intend to shoot at anyone, I shot out of fear.""

The court was adjourned for the day.

If you're planning to hit the beach this summer, now is the time to start working out. That could mean losing weight, bulking up or just supercharging the fitness goals you've been working on all winter long.

But if you're just getting started, or picking up after giving up on a past resolution, you'll want to pick a fitness program that will stick. After all, you only have so much time and energy each day -- you'll want to be as efficient as possible.

[seealso slug=""weekend-apps""]

A personalized fitness program will cater to your body's unique needs. There are lots of exercises that can be done at home or on your own, and many don't require an expensive personal trainer. Alternatively, group fitness classes or wandering through the gym for an hour can sometimes make you feel like you're working out, but without the desired results.

If you're looking to maximize the time in your week to the best workout for your body, check out the tools below that offer workouts customized to your personal plan and preferences.

1. Fitocracy Group Classes

Credit: Fitocracy

From the beginning, Fitocracy was about gamified fitness and using social interactions to keep people motivated.

Now, the company has formalized the process and involved trainers with a program launched in late 2013 called Group Fitness(Opens in a new window). Each group has a theme -- such as Summer Body(Opens in a new window) or Eight Weeks to Beast Mode(Opens in a new window) -- so you can join one that is relevant to your goals. Then, you're given a personalized fitness program from the trainer, whom you're also able to message one-on-one, and the group does video chats to keep everyone motivated and on track. Most groups include nutritional recommendations as well.

Classes cost $50-$100 per month, a fraction of the cost of personal training in a gym.

2. Bodbot

If half your workout is spent Googling the name of an exercise to find a demonstration of how it should look, you definitely want to start using Bodbot. The app not only provides a personal workout routine, as heavy or frequent as you'd like, but also provides images and videos for each exercise.

7028128,A Touching Eulogy for Fan 'Princess' Lacey Holsworth From MSU Basketball Star,"Adreian Payne would have been the biggest star of Michigan State's deep March Madness run, had it not been for Lacey Holsworth. Instead, the 8-year-old cancer patient and passionate Spartans fan with whom Payne struck up an unlikely, but beautiful, friendship became the most heartwarming story of this year's college-basketball postseason.

Holsworth battled her disease just long enough to watch Payne -- the man she called ""Superman"" and a ""brother"" -- lead Michigan State to the NCAA tournament quarterfinals, where they lost to UConn on March 30. Earlier in the season, Holsworth had helped Payne cut down the nets after winning the Big Ten Conference tournament, and walked him out on the floor before his last home game for the Spartans -- an honor typically reserved for close family members.

On Wednesday -- less than 24 hours after the Holsworth family used social media to announce Lacey's death from a rare form of nerve cancer -- Payne took to Twitter to pay a touching tribute to the girl who was one of his smallest fans, but undoubtedly his biggest supporter.

[seealso url = ""http://mashable.com/2014/03/27/march-madness-lacey-michigan-state""]

Payne, a rugged and skilled forward sure to be selected in June's NBA Draft, posted this message and photo from senior night to Twitter on Wednesday evening:

Earlier Wednesday, Payne posted this photo to Instagram with a caption reading: ""My Lil princess Lacey is an angel from god that will now watch over me. For ever and ever.#RIPLACEY""

Payne first met Lacey two years ago when the Michigan State basketball team visited a local hospital. Sports teams visiting hospitalized kids are a routine thing, but Payne and Lacey clicked in an uncommon way, according to the Detroit Free Press(Opens in a new window). Payne was moved by her optimism and upbeat personality despite being seriously ill, and the two used social media and text messages to keep in touch. Payne also continued to visit Lacey and her family in person, and the Holsworths became a common sight at the Breslin Center, Michigan State's home arena.

After Lacey's death, the Holsworth family posted this photo on Instagram, with a caption reading: ""Princess Lacey has achieved the ultimate victory. She now dances among angels.... The world is a better place because you were in it. Our hearts are broken. We love you Doll. Dance all night...""

Payne and Lacey's friendship became the social web's hottest March Madness story this year. Other Michigan State players and Spartans coach Tom Izzo threw their public support behind her. National fans, media and players alike became touched by the friendship. Indeed, the name ""Lacey Holsworth"" was searched(Opens in a new window) on Google more than 100,000 times on Wednesday after news broke of her death.

A crowdfunding effort to raise money(Opens in a new window) for Lacey's treatment began after her story became a national sensation in mid-March. It's since received more than $89,000 in donations, which continue to pour in from supporters contributing money in her memory.

â€œShe calls me her â€˜Superman,â€™ but sheâ€™s the one whoâ€™s got the super strength,â€ Payne told the Free Press(Opens in a new window) in March. â€œSheâ€™s incredible with everything sheâ€™s gone through.

7008161,11 Reasons Why Pulling Messenger From Facebook Mobile Is a Terrible Idea,"[Update: Some time after we published this post. Facebook reached me with some clarifications and opposing views. In the spirit of transparency, and because I find them quite illuminating, I'm placing them below, in place with each of the points addressed by Facebook]

Facebook is making what could be its dumbest decision ever: Itâ€™s pulling chat out of the core Facebook app and forcing mobile users who want to chat to install its Facebook Messenger app.

This is a terrible idea. Here, Facebook, are my top 11 reasons why.

1. I don't need another app

I already have way too many installed and recently did some app spring cleaning to sort out the mess. If I add Facebook Messenger, Iâ€™m unlikely to use it often enough to want to keep it.

2. Facebook Messenger is sub-par

No one Iâ€™ve spoken to likes the app. To be fair, it does have a lot of positive reviews on iTunes(Opens in a new window). So maybe I'm just talking to the wrong people -- but I still don't want it.

Facebook: In the few months following the launch of Messenger 3.0, the number of people using Messenger grew more than 70% and we've seen a large increase in the number of messages sent.

[seealso slug=""facebook-men-and-women""]

3. If I wanted to use Facebook Messenger, I would have installed it

Since Iâ€™ve been a Facebook member for years and have been using the built-in chat for almost as long, you can assume that I like it the way it is, thank you very much.

4. This will actually hurt Facebook

If you insist on pulling chat out of Facebook Mobile, you will also suck the real-time nature out of the social platform for millions of users. You canâ€™t force people to install Facebook Messenger, so they may simply leave to find another platform with better real-time communications features. Is this why you bought WhatsApp?

Facebook: Messenger was rebuilt from the ground up to be an instant mobile-to-mobile communications platform for people who want to be reachable at all times -- we've found that people get replies 20% faster on Messenger than on Facebook.

5. You didn't ask first

Your own page on Facebook has 144 million Likes. Thatâ€™s a lot of engaged reach. Why didnâ€™t you ask some of the people who like you what they thought of this idea? Were you afraid they would say â€œHell, no!â€? Making this kind of radical change will leave a bad taste in usersâ€™ mouths. Remember, they canâ€™t stand when you change things. I know, youâ€™ve only just become a â€œmobile firstâ€ company, but expect this to hurt you on that front, as well.

Facebook: We have tested this in a handful of countries for the last several months and found that people enjoy the Messenger experience -- itâ€™s faster than messaging in the core app, and Messenger has features that arenâ€™t available in the core app like the Groups tab. (Weâ€™re also testing a new composer that includes a selfie cam and more ways to express yourself.)

6. Since I can't run two apps on one screen in iPhone, this is the worst idea ever

Seriously, I assume you want me running both the Facebook app and Messenger at the same time. The iPhone can multi-task, but for in-Facebook communication, Iâ€™d want both apps on screen (I really want one app). What do I do now?

Facebook: Messages are already disabled from the core app for people who have Messenger and Facebook installed. Linking between the two apps is quick and easy.

7. I love Chatheads, donâ€™t take them out of Facebook

Of all the things that came out of Facebook Home, Chatheads is the one winning idea. I love having the little heads pop up on my screen when itâ€™s time to chat, being able to drag and drop them and even being able to deep-six them when Iâ€™m done. Why would you take such a smart feature out of Facebook?

Facebook: Chat Heads arenâ€™t going anywhere on Android. In fact, people who download Messenger on Android gain Chat Heads because they were not a feature in the core Android app. The Android platform enables Chat Heads to sit on top of any application. This isnâ€™t possible on iOS and Chats Heads were built in the main iOS app because it was a quick and fun way to access your messages.

8. Switching apps will only increase annoyance

I assume that the little green button, the one that indicates someone is live on Facebook will remain, but now when I tap it in Facebook, a second app will load. Iâ€™ll be constantly switching back and forth, likely cursing Facebook the whole time.

Facebook: Tapping â€œReturn to Facebookâ€ from Messenger takes you right back to where you left off in the Facebook app. Just like tapping on News Feed from your Messages tab if you donâ€™t have Messenger installed.

9. Worst idea since Facebook Paper (or Home)

Donâ€™t take this the wrong way, Facebook, but your home-grown app business is shaping up to be a huge fail. Havenâ€™t you noticed how when you buy, it flies (Instagram) and when you build it fails (Home)? Messenger is, at least, familiar inside Facebook, but it really needs the whole environment around it to truly fly. Donâ€™t clip its wings.

Facebook: Since relaunching Messenger in October weâ€™ve seen an increase in usage by 70%. Mark [Zuckerberg] mentioned this on our last earnings call.

10. One of your biggest user bases, Moms and Dads, will hate you

Teens donâ€™t care because an increasing number of them are chatting elsewhere (see WhatsApp â€“ above â€“ and Snapchat), but parents live on your platform. Many of them are accessing Facebook through their iPad. If you take messenger out of there, you will have a revolt on your hands and as soon as parents figure out how to complain (â€œIs there a â€˜contact Usâ€™ somewhere on this site?â€), they will.

Facebook: This is only for the iOS and Android experience and does not apply to iPad.

11. Twitter will thank you for this huge f* ... mess up

Twitter is not much of a real-time chat tool, but the company did just introduce something just like that under its quirky Vine six-second creation tool. Sure, not a lot of regular people use Vine, but maybe Twitter will now consider embedding the whole service inside Twitter mobile, just to make you look silly.",4/9/2014 0:00,0.570815,6,3,0,4.510373,6,Entertainment,394,3574.499,2544.578,3900,0.37963,0.030556,0.024896,0.016598,0.533333,0.2,1100

Using just a simple touchscreen tablet, any soldier can send the Autonomous Aerial Cargo/Utility System (AACUS) on missions that might be too perilous for humans.

[seealso slug=""zuckerberg-facebook-connectivity-lab-internet-org""]

""Out initiative is to try to find methods through which we could have an entirely autonomous system do what a manned helicopter would do,"" Capt. Robert Palisin, assistant chief of naval research, said in the AACUS video demonstration.

Equipped with specialized on-board cameras, the AACUS can take off and land on its own by using laser sensors to define its flight path. The system can be used on a number of different helicopters, which would make deploying the system far less costly, according to the ONR.

Credit: ONR

A key feature of the system is that AACUS users don't need special training to use the system, making it ideal for potential deployment into the field in the near future. During testing, soldiers with no prior experience were able to successfully use the system within 15 minutes of trying it out.

""What we're developing here is a system that responds to a request in the field for supplies, develops its own route, flies there by itself without any oversight and comes in and selects its own landing sites,"" said AACUS program manager Max Snell. ""This is a truly autonomous design.""

Suggesting that the military is keeping an eye on commercial tech innovation, the ONR references the recent Amazon announcement regarding drone-assisted deliveries in its video demonstration. ""We're tying to do the same thing, but I want to bring 5,000 pounds to a marine in the field of bullets or batteries or water in that same fashion,"" Snell said in the video.

And while the tablets featured in the video do appear to be commercial devices, the research team isn't linking the system to any one hardware or software manufacturer. ""The user interface was designed to be platform agnostic, so it could be used with a broad array of aircrafts,"" Peter Vietti, ONR spokesperson, told Mashable.

Developed over the course of five years, AACUS has the ability to avoid ground-based and aerial obstacles such as telephone poles and wires. In addition to its autonomous abilities, AACUS can assist a human pilot attempting to land in challenging environments obscured by dust or heavy weather conditions.

Of course, as a unit of the military, the ultimate use of the AACUS won't be focused on convenience, but combat. ""One of the longterm goals is probably to get this system to where it is able to do medical evacuation or casualty evacuation,"" Snell said.",4/9/2014 0:00,0.418448,9,15,0,4.680511,4,Entertainment,1609.905,3574.499,2856.17,626.8,0.363136,0.11673,0.062833,0.018104,0,0,902

SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket carrying the company's unmanned Dragon vehicle loaded down with supplies is expected to launch from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida on April 14. This will be SpaceX's third official flight to the station under a $1.6 billion contract with NASA to fly 12 missions to the orbiting outpost using the Dragon capsule and Falcon 9 rocket. You can watch the SpaceX launch live(Opens in a new window) on Space.com via NASA TV starting at 3:45 p.m. EDT on April 14. Launch is scheduled for 4:58 EDT.

Dragon will fly to the station loaded down with 5,000 lbs. of cargo and scientific experiments, according to NASA. The supplies include legs for Robonaut 2, a humanoid robot designed to eventually assist astronauts on the station with their day-to-day tasks. SpaceX initially aimed to launch the Dragon delivery mission in March, but damage to a ground-based U.S. Air Force radar station used to support Florida launches delayed the flight.

""These new legs, funded by NASA's Human Exploration and Operations and Space Technology mission directorates, will provide R2 (Robonaut 2(Opens in a new window)) the mobility it needs to help with regular and repetitive tasks inside and outside the space station,"" NASA officials said in a statement on March 12. ""The goal is to free up the crew for more critical work, including scientific research.""

SpaceX's Dragon(Opens in a new window) will stay attached to the station's Harmony module until mid-May when it will detach and splash down in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Baja California, NASA officials said. When it splashes down, Dragon is expected to be carrying about 3,000 lbs. of experiments and equipment that can be recovered on Earth.

At the moment, Dragon capsules are the only robotic cargo vehicles capable of bringing supplies back to Earth from the orbiting outpost. Other robotic spacecraft like Russia's Progress vehicles or Europe's Automated Transfer Vehicles can deliver supplies to the station, but are designed to burn up in Earth's atmosphere after leaving port.

5444102,The Masters Without Tiger? How Woods Grew Up at Augusta,"A back injury will force golf legend Tiger Woods to miss the Masters for the first time since he first competed in golf's most iconic event as a precocious 19-year-old amateur back in 1995. When Woods' streak snapped just shy of its 20-year mark, the sports world turned to reckoning about his long and storied career -- both where it's been and where it's going.

Woods was a sports figure of massive proportions for years, then became a disgraced hero after revelations about years of infidelity tore his family apart and tarnished his public image in 2009. Woods hasn't been quite the same golfer since that drawn-out scandal, and many armchair pundits blame the psychological fallout.

[seealso url = ""http://mashable.com/2014/04/04/tbt-the-basketball-tournament""]

But now, new questions: Is his body giving way? Is this the end of any semblance of the Tiger Woods we once knew? Does he have any remaining chance at all of breaking Jack Nicklaus' record 18 major-tournament wins?

That sort of fatalistic thinking may be over-the-top, but Woods' absence from the Augusta National Golf Club this week is a good time to look back at his career, with the sports legend at 38 years old. He donned the green jacket four times in total, most recently in 2005. Those four wins may seem insignificant for a man with $172,263,070 million(Opens in a new window) in career earnings, but the Masters have in many ways symbolized the soul of Woods' career.

Woods' father Earl, who was instrumental to his son's early success, accompanied Tiger to Augusta when the younger Woods (at the time a Stanford student) first competed as an amateur in 1995. Woods won his first major there, at the 1997 Masters, at the young age of 21. In 2010, the Masters tournament was where Woods first re-entered the public eye (at least willingly) following his damaging and embarrassing marriage scandal.

Below, find 14 photos of Tiger at Augusta, spanning 1995 through 2013. As a whole, they show the trajectory of quite possibly the most fascinating career in golf history.

For the fashion-tech enthusiast, the film promises to address -- and maybe answer -- some of the business's burning questions: Will the fast-fashion, mass production model continue, or will the industry return to handmade, high-quality garments? Will high-tech and smart clothing become commonplace, or will innovation come from revisiting traditional production methods? Will clothing become a mostly digital medium -- as Studio XO co-founder Nancy Tilbury puts it, a ""Tumblr of the body""?

Tilbury's studio has outfitted Lady Gaga with a 3D-printed, bubble-blowing dress, Azealia Banks with a digital ""mermaid bra"" that sparkled in time to her music, and Arcade Fire lead singer Win Butler with a cube-shaped helmet that projected Prince's face over his own. She is, perhaps, ideally placed to speculate on the future of fashion.

7027806,Toyota Recalls 6.4 Million Vehicles,"Toyota is recalling 6.39 million vehicles globally due to five separate issues, the company has announced.

The recall affects 27 Toyota models, including Yaris, Corolla and RAV4, as well as Pontiac Vibe and Subaru Trezia, the two models Toyota built for General Motors and Fuji Heavy Industries.

Toyota is recalling a majority of the cars -- some 3.5 million vehicles globally, 2.34 million of which were sold in North America -- due to problems with a spiral cable, which could be damaged when the steering wheel is turned, causing the air bag to fail. Other issues include problems with a spring that locks the seat rail in its position, steering columns, windscreen wipers and a fire risk with engine starters.

Toyota said none of the issues described above have caused crashes, injuries or fatalities.

The company's shares(Opens in a new window) fell sharply by approximately 2% after the announcement.

The news come two months after Toyota announced it will recall 1.9 million Prius hybrid cars due to a software issue which could cause the car to stop while driving. The company also recalled some 87,000 model year 2010 Priuses and Lexus HS 250HS vehicles in June 2013 due to an issue with the brake pressure accumulator. And in 2012, Toyota recalled 7.43 million vehicles due to problems with power window switches.

5465579,What Will Travel Look Like in 2024?,"Space tourism isnâ€™t quite a reality yet, but travel technology has still come a long way from where it was a few decades ago.

GPS is a big improvement on the paper map, a majority(Opens in a new window) of all travel reservations are made online, and wearables are gaining traction.

As technology continues to improve, itâ€™s worth asking: What will travel look like in the future? Travel search site Skyscanner has a new report(Opens in a new window) out on Wednesday that takes a stab at answering that question.

Filip Filipov, Skyscanner's head of B2B, said his team was amazed at the technological strides made in recent years. Looking at the trends emerging in the past decade, the team wondered how such strides would apply over the next 10 years.

The report combines the site's online booking data with analysis from 56 experts to identify the three biggest trends that will shape a typical traveler's experience in 2024.

1. Digital assistants

The first trend in the report is the growth of ""digital travel buddies,â€ personalized virtual assistants that remember your preferences and join in on the road. ""Miniaturized, wearable technology will be able to provide simultaneous feedback, such as real-time translations, as well as include holographic displays of airport maps or neighborhoods,"" the report reads.

We've already seen this trend in action -- Siri is just one example. More integration with travel planning, including booking sites and destination guides, is a natural next step.

â€œIn the 2020s, each of us will have an individual â€˜e-agentâ€™ that goes everywhere with us, inside a watch or a small piece of jewelry,â€ Daniel Burrus, author of Technotrends: How to Use Technology to Go Beyond Your Competition, told Skyscanner.

2. Virtual reality

A virtual trip to a tropical destination sounds appealing -- especially if it could fit into a lunch break -- but the biggest use for virtual reality may be to offer a preview before booking.

Virtual reality wonâ€™t replace travel, according to Filipov, but will instead allow hotels and destinations to show travelers exactly what experience they can book.

3. Semantic search

Online travel search has a long way to go to personalize search results for individual travelers, but the potential and interest exists. Semantic search would customize results for every traveler, allowing travel companies to understand exactly what a traveler wants.

According to the report, tools could even be developed to detect facial expressions and adjust results based on a person's reaction to an initial travel suggestion.

â€œEssentially, think of a world of travel where the traveler comes first,"" Filipov sad.

But the founders of Truth(Opens in a new window) created an anonymous messaging app that sends private missives to people on your contacts list. It's incognito one-on-one messaging between friends.

When you send a ""truth,"" you are assigned an anonymous username and avatar (one of an assortment of playful owls). If the recipient already has the app, the message will show up in the app's inbox. If they don't, a text message will display part of the ""truth"" and prompt the recipient to download the app.

""Whisper and Secret are about broadcasting,"" Truth cofounder Ali Saheli tells Mashable. ""You shout out anonymously, kind of like on Twitter. The concept of [messaging] phone contacts was more interesting to us.""

[seealso slug=""10-mobile-apps-work""]

The app officially debuted April 1, after spending several weeks in public beta in Canada. During that time it cracked the top 100 on the Canadian App Store, coming in 90th and beating out Secret. Saheli says Truth has gained most of its following in Vancouver, but it recently received an unexpected boost from high school and college-age users in New York, California and Florida.

Anonymous messaging apps are a hot ticket right now, especially among young people whose interest in now-traditional social media like Facebook and Twitter is waning. Last month, Secret raised(Opens in a new window) $8.6 million in funding from several investors, including Google Ventures. Whisper, meanwhile, raised $21 million from Sequoia Capital in September. And there are plenty of hungry runners-up in the space, such as Rumr(Opens in a new window) and Backchat(Opens in a new window), which was created by a high school student.

On the other hand, the concept of communicating anonymously still has a pretty bad rep, and much ink has spilled over their cyberbullying potential. According to a 2011 study(Opens in a new window) by Pew Research Center's Internet & American Life Project, 9 in 10 teens have witnessed cruel or bullying behavior on social media networks.

A Truth user can only message people already in her phone's contacts, however, which the founders hope will encourage playful messages and pranks between friends rather than aggressive trolling or threats.

""We try to keep it light and playful,"" Saheli says. He estimates(Opens in a new window) content reported as abusive represents less than 5% of all messages. ""The most common usage [of Truth] is flirting with classmates. And obviously we've seen a range of uses, like people giving feedback in workplaces.""

Saheli adds that the app has controls in place to monitor abusive content. ""We have had abusive messages, and we knew that would happen from day one,"" he says.

Carmen Tsang, a 24-year-old recruiter from Vancouver, mainly uses Truth to speak honestly with her friends, sometimes calling them out on their behavior. ""I think if you give feedback [to a friend] with your name attached to it, it can be awkward, and people take it too personally,"" she says. ""When it's anonymous, they can take it more objectively.""

Tsang has received a few ""truths"" of her own, which are ""usually quite flirtatious, so that's kind of fun,"" she says. ""You're just playing a game to figure things out.""",4/9/2014 0:00,0.630178,18,1,1,4.867606,6,Business,0,5600.998,2086.362,4800,0.395563,0.136526,0.025352,0.002817,0,0,13600

This protest, carried out by Greenpeace demonstrators outside Twitter's San Francisco headquarters, attempted to raise awareness of a different matter: renewable energy.

Greenpeace(Opens in a new window) ""hatched"" a green Twitter bird from a large green egg on the sidewalk in front of Twitter's office, attracting attention from passersby while passing out small green easter eggs to Twitter employees as they walked into work.

""Weâ€™re asking Twitter to join some of their peers in Silicon Valley to make the Internet clean,â€ said Gary Cook, a senior IT analyst for Greenpeace and the organization's spokesperson at the event. â€œUnfortunately Twitter has not joined that race ... Twitterâ€™s been a very transformative platform. Literally itâ€™s helping to change governments. We want them to change their energy and join others to help build a green Internet.â€

The protest comes on the heels of a recent Greenpeace report(Opens in a new window) [PDF] published last week found Twitter is lagging behind other major tech companies in utilizing renewable energy to power company data centers. Twitter does not own any of its own data centers, but reportedly rents from third-party companies that aren't making renewable energy a priority, the report found.

According to the Greenpeace report, Twitter's facilities combined use 21% renewable energy, well below Facebook (49%), Google (48%), and Apple, which now uses 100% renewable energy to power its iCloud.

A Twitter spokesperson responded to the protest in a statement given to Mashable: ""As we build out our infrastructure, we continue to strive for even greater efficiency of operations. We welcome any constructive feedback that helps us get there.""

San Francisco has been the breeding ground for a number of protests targeting tech companies in recent months, but those have mainly centered around Google Buses, the fleet of tech shuttles that transport employees from San Francisco to tech campuses at companies like Google, Apple, Facebook, and Cisco, which residents blame as a symbol of the rapidity with which neighborhoods here are gentrifying.

Those protests have been getting more aggressive as of late, with private homes picketed and buses vandalized. Wednesday's Greenpeace demonstration was peaceful, however, and did not carry the same animosity that Google Bus protests have generated.

The Greenpeace report awarded poor grades(Opens in a new window) to Twitter, which got three ""F"" markings and one ""D"" in categories like transparency, renewable energy commitment, and renewable energy deployment.

Twitter only uses 21% renewable, clean energy, according to a Greenpeace study released last week. Credit: Greenpeace

As it was two years ago, Twitter remains at the bottom of the industry for energy transparency, disclosing no information about its energy footprint. Twitter lags behind companies like Salesforce and Box, which have shown that it is possible for those leasing data center space to commit to a long-term goal of being 100% renewably powered. Twitter also lags behind its peer and competitor in social media, Facebook, which took steps to adopt clean energy soon after it went public.

Twitter was not alone in receiving poor grades from Greenpeace, however. Oracle was awarded two ""D"" grades and one ""F,"" and Amazon received the same markings as Twitter on its report card.

Cooks says that there are other companies in San Francisco who may be targeted by Greenpeace as well, but the organization is hoping to start with a commitment to work toward renewable energy from Twitter.

â€œItâ€™s not going to happen overnight,"" he says.

7027932,Ukraine's Zoo Animals Struggle to Survive Amid Political Turmoil,"When ousted Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych fled(Opens in a new window) the country in February, he left behind a nation, a mansion and a pristine 343-acre zoo.

The zoo's animals and its employees were left to find food and money themselves, and the interim government hasn't been able to help it, given Ukraine's economy is struggling to survive. For now, officials say there's not enough funding to support Yanukovych's former zoo and several others throughout the country that have sought donations to prevent animal starvation, such as the zoo in Nikolaev.

""The [Nikolaev] zoo still aesthetically looks good,"" said Lionel de Lange, who helped coordinate emergency supplies for Yanukovych's zoo and the one in Nikolaev. ""We were able to get the animals a lot of food and medicine in the nick of the moment.""

De Lange, a South African man who has lived in Ukraine for years, told Mashable that he wasn't looking to get involved in the effort to save Ukraine's zoos, until three weeks ago, when he read about the starving animals at the Nikolaev zoo, which is close to where he lives.

He immediately thought of fellow South African Lawrence Anthony, the famous conservationist who rushed in to save what animals he could from the Baghdad Zoo(Opens in a new window) after the United States invaded Iraq in 2003. De Lange reached out to the Lawrence Anthony Earth Organization, and was soon on the phone up to seven times a day with the group's president, Barbara Wiseman, discussing how they could save Ukraine's zoo creatures.

The two coordinated a shipment of food to the zoo two days before the carnivores would have run out, according to Wiseman. Now, they have to figure out how they're going to keep feeding the 6,000 animals at Nikolaev and the 2,000 who call Yanukovych's zoo home -- not to mention all the other zoos around the country.

â€œWe were able to avert the disaster, but itâ€™s very, very tenuous right now,"" Wiseman said.

Through donations and by coordinating with vendors--some that provide food specifically for exotic creatures, while others are more like big-butcher shops--Wiseman's organization has stockpiled enough money for about one month's worth of food for the 8,000 animals now ostensibly in its care. The goal is to quickly accumulate a four months' supply, which Wiseman estimated would cost about $500,000. That will give them time to come up with a more longterm plan.

Some Ukrainian zoos have already made desperate calls for help. In early March, the Kharkiv Zoo rallied locals to provide table scraps to animals there because they had run out of food. Wiseman said the Earth Organization is ""in discussions"" with Kharkiv but hasn't starting shipping supplies. Animals are already sick from some of the food people provided -- certain species can't eat the same foods as humans -- and Wiseman worries that the situation will deteriorate further.

â€œWhile well-intended, thatâ€™s not the solution,"" Wiseman said. ""A longterm solutionâ€™s got to be put in place.â€

De Lange is in talks with other zoos about providing help, but he and the Earth Organization are moving carefully. They don't want to make promises that are impossible to keep, and Wiseman is wary that funds her group provides to people may not result in food for the animals.

â€œYou have to make sure the money that is going there is really going to the animals,"" Wiseman said.

Plus, the situation at Yanukovych's zoo is far from stable. Staff members there haven't been paid in months, and some have left. There aren't enough employees to maintain the 343 animal-filled acres.

""If they went home, the animals would get poached or stolen,"" de Lange said of the zoo's staff. ""They do night patrol. They literally lock the gates.""

There are already reports of stolen animals as looters continue to sift through what's left of Yanukovych's former life. The interim government has said it will provide money for employees there, according to Wiseman, but nothing's happened so far. Ideally, the government would step in and help run the zoos, but no one is in a position to think that far ahead just yet.

Certainly, there will be a rush to upgrade older systems after Microsoft kicked XP to the curb on Tuesday, but looking at simple numbers -- more than 27%(Opens in a new window) of all computers worldwide still run the software -- holdouts are inevitable.

That poses a growing danger not just to those PCs, but to any system coming into contact with them. With significant market share and no more official support, Windows XP will become a prime target for malware creators.

[seealso slug=""windows-xp-buried-and-undead""]

With XP, Microsoft began a kind of tradition knowns as ""patch Tuesday."" Every month, the company would push out updates to to the various versions of Windows to fix bugs and close holes that could compromise system security. Starting in May, Windows XP won't be included in those updates.

""XP shipped in 2001,"" explains Tom Murphy, director of communications for Microsoft Windows. ""That means the engineering and design work went on in the late '90s. From a security perspective, XP inherently isn't designed to protect you from the kinds of threats we see online today.""

The evolution of Windows security

Windows 7, for example, tightened access to key system files, even from system administrators. Windows 8 (and later 8.1) took things even further with extensive ""sandboxing"" of apps -- restricting how much data they can share. But XP is a much less controlled environment. And since its just one in a long line of Windows versions, the problem is even worse.

""It's not like [security] holes are going to stop being discovered,"" says Gerry Egan, senior director of product management at Symantec. ""Even worse, holes will continue to be discovered across newer OSes that are relevant to older OSes. But these vulnerabilities being disclosed will provide a road map in many ways for attackers.""

That puts more of a burden on security companies to pick up where Microsoft left off. They're more than happy to do so, since all those XP machines still out there will need to double down on malware protection.

""It's probably our biggest opportunity,"" says Gary Kovacs, CEO of AVG, which provides ""freemium"" antivirus software. ""People are just not in a hurry to upgrade. Antivirus [software] becomes something they subscribe to, to take care of the stuff that used to be in XP. Since it's no longer supported, we're seeing an uptick in downloads.""

Even though most security companies won't be ending support for the XP versions of their software, they still want you to upgrade. As time goes on, XP machines will become less and less secure as holes crop up. While upgrading malware protection will help, it's an inherently less effective solution.

""Imagine I discover a broken window latch in my house,"" explains Egan. ""I may have a home security system, with motion detectors that will set off an alarm if anyone jumps in, and I can call the police. But the best fix is to fix the latch in the first place.""

If a malware creator wants to take advantage of a security hole, it's easier than ever to do so. People intent on distributing malicious software sometimes don't even need extensive knowledge of coding or app development.

""Now you see 'malware as a service,' where they're buying modules,"" says Kovacs. ""So if I want to hijack machines for clickfraud, I dont even have to develop the malware anymore.""

How to flee a dying OS

Many large businesses haven't upgraded from Windows XP for many reasons -- mainly cost, usability and compatibility with custom software. The majority of ATMs, for example, still run some version of XP.

For those organizations that are reluctant to upgrade, Microsoft put in some tools in the latest Windows 8.1 Update that will improve compatibility with older custom software. And for large-scale upgrades that will take time, Microsoft will actually support certain enterprise versions of XP past the expiration date.

""Many large companies have a complex migration process,"" says Murphy. ""With larger customers, we will provide temporary support for XP machines that are in the process of being migrated. It's a temporary measure -- the path of last resort.""

Consumers and small businesses don't have that option, of course, and Microsoft is doing everything it can to convince them to upgrade. The company provides extensive online guides(Opens in a new window) for upgrading to a newer system, tools for copying files and settings(Opens in a new window), and even a dirt-simple site, amirunningxp.com(Opens in a new window), for those who may actually be unsure what their OS is.

For those who insist on sticking with XP, security vendors will support it for the foreseeable future. The risk of infection, however, will increase over time, potentially threatening other systems.

While skeptics might question Microsoft's decision to end XP support with such a significant slice of the market still running the OS, it's done. And future Windows patches will provide malicious parties all the data they need to infect those older systems. The message couldn't be clearer: For the good of your data and everyone else's, ditch Windows XP as soon as you can.",4/9/2014 0:00,0.399012,12,12,0,4.299641,10,Lifestyle,2429.059,6612.625,3750.795,2702.333,0.467373,0.132578,0.04366,0.017344,0,0,1600
7024678,5 Essential Topics Every Email Marketer Should Understand,"Some years ago, OK many years ago, I joined a custom publishing agency. My first week was one of deep orientation. During that week I was taken through the details of the publishing process. I was taught about the print process: the different types of printers, paper, and printing techniques; color processes, CMYK and spot color; collation, distribution, and the postal system. I was taught about copy writing, editing, layout and proofing, and all the other steps that go into creating the final product. In short I got a five-day backgrounder on how the underlying technologies and processes of the industry worked and how they impacted our work.

What I've come to realize is that in today's digital marketing world, it's very rare that an email marketer gets this kind of background. And I don't mean in print, I mean in email. I commonly come across email marketers who don't know how the channel that is the basis of our livelihood works. Here then are my top five things that every email marketer should know.

1. How Email Is Delivered

I believe every email marketer should know how this works, how their message actually gets delivered, from the basics of mail servers and DNS through to the SMTP (Simple Mail Transport Protocol) transport and delivery of email.

It may seem technical and irrelevant to marketers, but this is important knowledge because it has a significant impact in a wide range of areas. Spam filtering depends on and impacts this process. To understand blocking and filtering, the difference between an RBL and a URIBL means understanding this process. To understand what bounce codes and responses mean and how they impact your delivery requires understanding of this process.

2. How Email Is Displayed

HTML (hypertext markup language) is the language of email. The HTML dialect for email is different to that for websites. The capabilities and limitations in regards to email are important and becoming more so. The growth of mobile and adoption of mobile-first and responsive designs change how our messages look and why. Every email marketer should understand what can and can't be done, what should and should not be done, why content displays differently on different platforms, and how responsive design works.

3. Basic Statistics

Email is a data-driven medium. Unfortunately, all too often email marketers come from non-mathematical backgrounds and never learned these basics. We receive a deluge of data about our programs and campaigns. What often surprises me, though, is how little that data gets used. Top-line metrics such as delivery, open, and click rates are compared month on month but often there's little more than that.

Simply knowing what makes a test good and a result statistically significant is invaluable. Effective use of the available data can make the difference between a good program and a great one.

4. Privacy and Security

As I wrote back in February(Opens in a new window), email marketers are handling a growing quantity of data and increasingly make essential decisions about collection, storage, transfer, and use of that data. Every email marketer needs to be up on both privacy and security and how it impacts what we do every single day.

There is often a significant disconnect between the policy and the practice of data privacy and security. Understanding the fundamentals, the whys, and wherefores removes that disconnect and enables email marketers to make smart decisions even when the privacy group is not around.

5. Direct Marketing Fundamentals

Email marketers come from a range of backgrounds and email is such an effective channel that it seems oftentimes we can get away with ignoring marketing fundamentals and still get great return on investment (ROI). But even though it's a unique channel, email marketing is still direct marketing and the fundamentals are important.

The four Ps of Product, Price, Place, and Promotion and the three Ms of Market, Message, and Medium are still very relevant foundations to effective marketing in the age of the fragmented customer journey, the mobile consumer, and cross-channel messaging.

I want to be clear that I'm not saying email marketers should know how to write a mail server, be HTML coding wizards, or Ph.D. statisticians. We are doing data-driven marketing with email and an understanding of the fundamental aspects of data, marketing, and email are important. Without these fundamentals we're in no position to have serious discussions about the subtleties and nuances of email strategies and tactics. Instead, we'll be continually rehashing the same conversations and readdressing the same misconceptions.

7027788,You Thought 4K TV Looked Real? This One Goes to 8K,"Did you enjoy that hot minute of thinking 4K was the end-all, be-all for the living room TV?

If youâ€™ve been to an electronics store in the past few months, youâ€™ve seen the candy-colored, crystalline images of 4K televisions, with four times the resolution of the 1080p HD set you have at home. The difference is stunning.

SEE ALSO: Everything You Need to Know About 4K Video in Less Than 2 Minutes

4K TVs are getting within reach now: A 55â€ Sony goes from upwards of $2500. Thereâ€™s precious little content for it outside some 4K-mastered Blu-rays from Sony and a specialty YouTube channel, but more stuff to watch will arrive soon enough, just as it did with 1080pi.

Now along comes Japanâ€™s public broadcasting organization NHK with 8K, a format so dense with detail that the human eye will not detect additional resolution -- a claim I've heard made for 4K. I guess now we can be doubly sure there's no way to make it look better.

After the third or fourth time someone here at the NAB Show in Las Vegas asked whether I'd seen NHK's display I went down Wednesday to find, during an otherwise quiet late-morning moment on the convention floor, people were already lining up around the enclosure 20 minutes before what would be a packed showtime.

Credit:

NHK showed about 30 minutes of footage, including a Japanese fireworks display, a whimsical short film by a performing arts troupe, a fashion show in a large arena and footage from a soccer match between Brazil and Spain.

Oh it looks real. And it is spectacular.

The clarity and depth of field truly is uncanny, yet the picture had none of the harsh edges, strange light and â€œvideoâ€ vibe of other super-HD displays and high frame-rate demos I've seen. Itâ€™s somehow cinematic; yet you can focus in on any face in a large crowd and make out every feature at varying distances. It really is like being there.

Even the smaller TV screens give objects a more present look â€“ a space shuttle launch contrail looked like you could just wave your hand and blow it away, and I felt like I could reach in and pluck a colorful banner from a field of charging horsemen.

Credit:

3D is already wobbling off to international markets, and if something like 8K ever catches on here, it wonâ€™t help it. During the fireworks display footage, birds that fly into the shot had me thinking some sparrows had gotten into the place. Stereovision would be overkill.

Though both Samsung and Sharp also put on 8K displays back at the Consumer Electronics Show earlier this year, you wonâ€™t see screens in stores anytime soon; some don't even see the data-guzzler as a viable format. If 8K screens ever do arrive, surely it will be ahead of pipelines fully equipped to handle them, as the NHK's first test broadcasts don't come until 2016.

Sports will lead the first broadcast yet again, this time with the Tokyo Olympics, which NHK has pledged to cover and broadcast throughout much of Japan. NHK is also filming the World Cup in Brazil this summer with its 8K Cube camera, a breadbox-sized unit which a spokeswoman held up for us to see with her left hand.

Shooting with this will be a breeze. It'll be fun to see whether NHK can get enough traction for a rich content pipeline.

7024262,Aereo Coming to Chromecast,"Streaming TV service Aereo is coming to the Chromecast on May 29.

An upcoming update to the Aereo for Android app will add Chromecast support. This will let Aereo subscribers fling their live TV or cloud DVR programs from a phone or tablet to a Chromecast with the tap of a button.

SEE ALSO: Google Throws Open the Doors for More Chromecast Apps

Aereo is already available on iOS, Chrome, Safari, Internet Explorer, Roku and Apple TV (via AirPlay). The Aereo for Android app has been available in beta since October for devices running Android 4.1.1 ""Jelly Bean"" or higher.

The Chromecast, of course, is Google's $35 dongle that allows users to fling content from an app or web page to a TV screen wirelessly. Over the last few months, we've seen an increase of interest from developers and content creators, especially as the Chromecast finds its way into more living rooms.

Aereo is a currently available in 11 markets, including New York, Atlanta, Miami and Austin, with more plans to expand to other markets throughout 2014. For $8 a month, users can access local channels (including ABC, NBC, CBS, Fox and PBS) via the web or a connected device and record up to 20 hours of programming on a cloud-based DVR.

Before Aereo makes its way to the Chromecast, it will have its day in front of the United States Supreme Court. Major broadcast networks, including ABC, CBS and Fox, are suing Aereo, claiming the service violates copyright and existing retransmission laws.

After a slew of lower court battles (which all ended in Aereo's favor), the highest court in the land will determine Aereo's fate. The hearing is scheduled later this month, with a decision expected before the court recesses at the end of June.

For Aereo as a business, the stakes could not be higher. Earlier this month, Barry Diller, whose company IAC is Aereo's financial backer, told Bloomberg TV that Aereo's future is in the hands of the court. ""If we lose, we're finished.""",4/10/2014 0:00,0.500792,11,5,0,4.477273,8,Lifestyle,1300,49250,9555.503,1800,0.447849,0.165816,0.057576,0.016667,0,0,1500
7007895,"10 Drinks and 10 Days, With a Connected Breathalyzer","In a movie theater, the feature film was just about to start and my 15 minutes was up. I pulled out my iPhone and plugged a small black device into the headphone jack, tilting my phone's bright screen to the ground so I wouldn't distract the other moviegoers. Slowly I blew into the device for a few seconds until my phone vibrated. Then I checked the result -- a blood alcohol concentration of 0.052.

I was using Alcohoot, a breathalyzer that connects to your smartphone. The device was released last fall, and it isn't alone. Another connected breathalyzer, Floome, is scheduled to go on sale this year and was featured in Proto Labs' Cool Idea Awards(Opens in a new window). These are consumer devices, but it's not clear if the purpose is entertainment or safety.

On the regulatory side, Ignition Interlock Devices(Opens in a new window) in cars have been around since the 1980s, and prevent a person convicted of a DUI from starting the car if he or she has been drinking.

Beyond compulsory use, measuring one's own BAC on a night out -- or even a night in -- could be part of the quantified self movement. It just isn't as sexy as a wristband that measures steps or sweat, such as Nike Fuel.

[seealso slug=""calendar-apps/""]

After experimenting with Alcohoot over the past month with 10 different drinks, I discovered the device was far from a party foul. Perhaps it's novelty, but pulling a connected breathalyzer out of my purse at a group dinner was the equivalent of dropping some juicy gossip. Others begged to try it out themselves.

The downside: The data just isn't actionable. It's a resounding critique we've come to expect in the activity tracker market and the quantified self movement in general.

The nuances in logging a reliable BAC are serious enough that you may not want to depend on a personal device to make decisions about driving.

Thus, the personal connected breathalyzer seems to go the way of many other quantified self devices -- it's a great tool for personal enlightenment.

The headphone plug on Alcohoot is retractable so it can fit comfortably inside a pocket. Credit:

Alcohoot recommends you wait 15 minutes after your last drink before measuring; a handy timer is one feature of its app. But it's possible your BAC will continue to rise for 30 minutes to an hour after your last drink, depending what you've had to eat and how much time you spend drinking (this is why rising blood alcohol(Opens in a new window) can be used as a defense in drunk driving cases).

The Alcohoot app, which logs your BAC every time you blow, can help call an Uber or find a nearby restaurant at which to sober up. If you're over your country's legal limit(Opens in a new window) (0.08 in the U.S.), it recommends not driving, for fear of a ticket or worse.

After using Alcohoot on 10 drinks over 10 separate days, I now have a much better idea how each type of drink affects me. I was surprised to find a craft IPA was not much more potent than a cheap beer, and that food really does make a difference -- I could feel a buzz after a mimosa with brunch, but still clocked in at 0.00 BAC.

Of course, every person metabolizes alcohol differently, so take the examples below with caution (case in point, at dinner with a friend, my two glasses of Vespa Bianco got me to 0.059, while his two glasses of Prosecco equaled 0.022). In these examples I generally ate a meal prior to drinking, and I travel by subway in NYC so driving after drinking was never an issue.

You can buy Alcohoot on the company's website for $119(Opens in a new window). It's compatible with iOS and Android.

1. Mimosa - 0.000 BAC

I went to brunch in Brooklyn with a friend and ate a bowl of house-made tater tots covered in scrambled eggs, cheese and guacamole, along with my second cup of coffee of the day. The mimosa was delicious and I don't doubt it contained real champagne, but alas, 0.000 BAC.

2. Mojito - 0.008 BAC

When I signed up for a group date with The Dating Ring, I knew it would be a good excuse to splurge on a fun cocktail instead of my usual glass of wine. I'd initially planned to check my BAC on my way home; I thought it would be awkward to pull out Alcohoot at the table among strangers. When the group decided to go for a second drink, I realized I needed to blow right away to measure only the first drink.

As it turned out, one person on the date insisted everyone at the table also measure his BAC. Only one person refused. Perhaps inconsequentially, the two eventually left the bar hand in hand.

3. Cheap Beer - 0.011 BAC

It was a weeknight and I decided to continue my drinking journey on a night in, while catching up with Portlandia on Netflix. The convenience store near my apartment has a decent selection of beer, including the kind I would never drink by choice, but I was curious if the type of beer would correspond at all with the eventual BAC. A can of Big Flats(Opens in a new window), which has 4.50% ABV, was only 0.002 BAC below a cup of Two-Hearted IPA(Opens in a new window), which has 7.00% ABV. Two cans of Big Flats got me to 0.019 BAC, still lower than a single glass of wine.

The cheapest beer I could find at my local convenience store was Big Flats, a six-pack for less than $5. Credit: danifankhauser

4. Craft Beer - 0.013 BAC

I went to a party held at Whole Foods' in-store pub, On Tap, to celebrate Susty Party's latest product line (biodegradable cup, pictured). The highly rated Two-Hearted IPA(Opens in a new window) was, well, on tap. While drinking I also munched on some locally sourced cookies, ice cream and an appetizer-portioned hot dog.

5. Whiskey - 0.013 BAC

I'm just beginning to develop a taste for whiskey as a standalone beverage, but haven't quite gotten the hang of ordering it yet. After I left a (dry) event, I decided to stop by a whiskey bar down the street from where I live, around 10 p.m., to do some reading on my Kindle. It was busy for a weeknight, but I found some free seating around the perimeter. I asked the bartender for a ""good whiskey for beginners."" He gave me Glen Grant on the rocks, which was indeed smooth and not at all intimidating.

6. Margarita - 0.015 BAC

Testing a connected breathalyzer is a good excuse to explore one's own neighborhood, so when I went looking for a margarita, I found a Mexican food restaurant a few blocks away. In my experience, margaritas can vary in both size and strength -- this one tasted decent in terms of strength, but was on the smaller end. Actually, it was half the size of the margaritas I used to get for Taco Tuesday when I lived in San Diego.

I browsed articles on Pocket and read Twitter while I drank, then set Alcohoot's 15-minute timer when I paid and left.

7. Rioja - 0.020 BAC

When you get a glass of wine at a wine bar, you're usually guaranteed a good pour, and that was definitely the case here. The glass itself was still large enough to allow for proper oxidation of the tempranillo blend from Rioja, Spain. Along with the wine, I shared a pizza with my OKCupid date, who wasn't drinking despite having agreed to meet at a wine bar.

8. Champagne - 0.033 BAC

A coworker and I went searching for an after-work drink venue and landed at the corner of the bar in an American food restaurant. My champagne was served in the standard flute, very unlike red wine's wide goblet, so it can be hard to compare by size. To add, the rumors that champagne's bubbles increase its ABV have gotten mixed scientific reviews(Opens in a new window). But at least in my experience, champagne seems to make a bigger impression than regular wine.

9. Jack Rose - 0.044 BAC

The only drink poured by a non-professional in this anecdotal study came at an office happy hour. The Jack Rose contains applejack, grenadine, and lemon or lime juice. It was popular in the 1920s and 1930s. While I'm told this one isn't popularly served in bars any longer, it could make a unique offering at a house party.

10. Shot and Beer - 0.052 BAC

Despite my desire to compare single drinks individually, I didn't feel right ordering a shot by itself. So, when I was on my way to a film screening, I found a bar with decent happy hour prices and got myself a shot of Cuervo along with Sam Adams Cherry Wheat. (Despite the bartender's recommendation against it, I found it quite tasty.)",4/10/2014 0:00,0.569912,12,1,0,4.865517,7,Lifestyle,2448.25,4744.008,3700.804,0,0.384303,0.159601,0.043103,0.017241,0.5,0.15,1500

7007870,Basis Carbon Steel Edition: A Wearable That's Actually Wearable,"In the last year alone, the question has shifted from whether weâ€™ll be wearing wearables in the near future to which one is our favorite and what we want to try next. In fact, thanks to the proliferation of fitness trackers from the likes of Jawbone and FitBit, it's only a matter of time before we start mentioning sleep and heart-rate information in casual conversation. So, for the sake of introductions, my name is Brian. I got two hours of REM sleep the other night, and my standing heart rate is 57.

I can also give you some information on how much I sweat, how many times I woke up in the middle of the night and precisely how warm my skin gets when Iâ€™m riding my bike to the grocery store -- but, then, what would we talk about on our second date?

SEE ALSO: 3 Fitness Trackers That Make a Run at Recording Heart Rate

One of the early adopters in the fitness tracking space is Basis, with its original B1 Band (introduced in late 2012). The product earned a name for itself for the thoroughness of the data it collects. Not only does it track footsteps and calories, the fitness watch gathers an impressive level of detail about whatâ€™s going on with your body when youâ€™re sitting, walking, running, biking and sleeping -- and that information has only grown in detail through subsequent software updates.

Back view of the Basis Carbon Steel Edition. Credit: Brian Heater/Mashable

In January, the company announced more updates to the watchâ€™s capabilities, mostly pertaining to how well it watches you sleep. Along with those upgrades came a fancy new version of the watch, the $200 Basis Carbon Steel Edition(Opens in a new window), which, like the recently refreshed Pebble smartwatch, takes a moment to focus on aesthetic and wearability â€” elements that werenâ€™t really given enough love in the first go-round. With that in mind, letâ€™s kick this off by talking looks.

Wearability above all

Weâ€™re still in the relatively early days of the wearable explosion and making wearables that are actually, you know, ""wear-able,"" hasnâ€™t really been a primary focus of a lot of manufacturers. Look at Samsungâ€™s first-generation Galaxy Gear. In its rush to build the smartwatchâ€™s brains, Samsung seemingly forgot that it was building a watch. The original Basis Band had similar issues, and the company fielded a lot of concerns from users about bulk and discomfort â€” both things that should be a chief concern when building a piece of hardware youâ€™re meant to wear all day and all night.

Full disclosure: I honestly canâ€™t remember the last time I wore a watch with any regularity. Like many out there, my obsessive compulsive need to check the time has been almost exclusively addressed by the phone Iâ€™ve got in my pockets at all time. So, when I first unboxed the Basis, I was a bit taken aback by the size of the thing. True, the company has gone a ways toward making the product more comfortable, slimming its profile a bit and making a much more flexible wristband, but the wearable is still considerably larger than the dumb watches most of us are used to wearing. Think about those old Casio G-Shocks and youâ€™re in the right ballpark.

It fits pretty comfortably, though, once you actually get it on. Granted, the strap still could be a bit more flexible, but thatâ€™ll likely come with wear and tear. After wearing it for a few hours, however, I found myself having to take it off to give my wrist a rest â€” though thatâ€™s a perfect opportunity to charge the watch up, seeing as how youâ€™re going to be wearing the thing to sleep.

Speaking of which, it may as well had been the first time Iâ€™ve intentionally worn a watch to sleep, but in spite of the deviceâ€™s size, it wasnâ€™t too awkward an experience â€” it certainly beats slipping on one of those Zeo tracker headbands. It also does a pretty good job of knowing exactly when youâ€™re boarding that express train to slumberland.

As for the look of the device, Basis still has a ways to go before one can, in good conscience, call the product â€œstylish.â€ The face of the watch hasnâ€™t changed much. The monochrome display is a diminutive 30 millimeters, making it tough to check when youâ€™re running â€” though, maybe itâ€™s best to focus on running when youâ€™re running. As with the B1, the face is mostly bezel â€” this is due in part that Basis opted to utilize a four-touch pin near the corners of the display, rather than including a touchscreen.

The result is a lot of toggling thatâ€™ll bring you back to the pre-smartwatch days. Checking your heart rate, for instance, requires you to tap one of the pins on the right side five times. The button on the upper left turns the backlighting on and off, while the one on the bottom left switches between the date and time. On the right side of the watch is a single, thin menu button. Tap that and use the pin to sync the device and toggle through Bluetooth settings. There are four pins on the other side for charging, which requires you to slip the watch into a somewhat flimsy plastic cradle.

On the back is a small eye that glows green when in use. This is surrounded by six more metal points. All of these rest against your skin when in use, collecting information on your heart beat, blood floor, skin temperature and sweat output (did we mention that the device is, thankfully water resistant?).

I got some comments from folks I know while wearing it out. Itâ€™s not flashy by any stretch, but itâ€™s hard to miss. No one found it particularly objectionable, but many asked what it did before I even had a chance to say anything, which is to say, itâ€™s pretty clear that the Basis isn't just a regular old digital wristwatch at first glance.

What the watch watches

After wearing the Basis around, I have to say, Iâ€™m pretty impressed by what it knows about me. Youâ€™ll only get the basics on the watchâ€™s display â€” which is not surprising, given the limited real estate there. Toggling through, you can find out the amount of calories youâ€™re burning, your current heart rate and the distance youâ€™ve run, biked and walked during the day. And indeed, the watch does a good job distinguishing all of those activities.

A look at the data. Credit:

If you want more information, youâ€™ll need to sync it to your Android or iOS device. The free app has a simple, clean layout, breaking up the amount of time youâ€™ve performed each activity, along with the specific times of day. Tap into one of those and you can get a more detailed break down of how many calories while exercising and how you slept last night. The latter is particularly interesting, letting you know what percentage of your sleep was light, deep and REM, and how many times you tossed and turned and woke up altogether. Apparently I had 38 toss/turns and got up twice. Clearly, I was too excited to review the basis to actually sleep.

The app also offers Habits â€” small goals in pursuit of bettering yourself, from running and walking more to getting more sleep time. â€œDonâ€™t be a sitterâ€ seemed as good a first goal as any â€” like most of you desk jockeys out there, I could stand to stand a bit more between 9 and 5 on weekdays. You can set the specific amounts of time, and the app will let you know how youâ€™re doing on a daily basis. And once youâ€™ve unlocked that goal, the app lets you set others.

When you need even more information, you can log into Basis' web portal. Here things get super, super detailed. Ever wanted to know, say, just how sweaty you get while biking? Honestly, I canâ€™t say I ever have, but it could perhaps be good information to share with your doctor -- though, as the company warns on its site, the watch isnâ€™t intended to be a replacement for actual medical monitoring equipment.

What to wear?

In the time Iâ€™ve spent wearing it, I canâ€™t honestly say Iâ€™ve forgotten that Iâ€™ve had the watch on, but the update to the device does make it much easier to wear -- and thatâ€™s well worth the extra $20 this device runs over its recently discounted predecessor. At $200, the Carbon Steel Edition falls somewhere between the FitBit Flex ($100) and the Pebble Steel ($250). Itâ€™s also somewhere between the two in terms of functionality.

You canâ€™t really call it a smartwatch, seeing as how you wonâ€™t be checking your driving directions or email messages, but the small display does bring functionality lacking in fitness bands, letting you check the time (hence the â€œwatchâ€ part) and monitor your activity in real-time (well, with a delay of a few seconds).The latter is great for those who need to micromanage such things, and may serve to push yourself harder as you attempt to hit those fitness goals.

And thatâ€™s really the whole point here: giving users the motivation they need to live a more active lifestyle. If youâ€™re looking for something thatâ€™ll help you track that information, while remaining mostly out of the way, Jawbone and FitBit offer much more indiscreet solutions. What Basis does offer, however, is a constant motivation to keep pushing yourself.

Spanning two weekends, Coachella is the largest and most well-known music festival in the United States, and its reputation has just as much to do with its being a wild party in the desert as with the musical groups it attracts.

More than 150 musical acts covering all genres will perform both weekends. Friday's headliner is Outkast. Muse will headline Saturday. Arcade Fire will close on Sunday. This year's lineup(Opens in a new window) also includes Lorde, Neko Case, The Replacements, Beck, Neutral Milk Hotel, Pixies, Foster the People, Queens of the Stone Age, Nas, Calvin Harris, Broken Bells, MotÃ¶rhead, Haim, MGMT, Girl Talk, Ellie Goulding, Lana Del Rey, Pharrell Williams, and many more.

In 2013, 90,000 people bought three-day passes to each of the two weekends. The festival took in $67 million, making it the highest-grossing festival ever according to Billboard(Opens in a new window). This year, tickets sold out in under three hours.

If you're heading to Coachella, here's what you need to know to make the most of the festival.

Coachella may be known as a wild party, but event organizers have something safer in mind.

Venue gates open at 11:00 a.m. every day, and everyone is subject to search when entering. A festival pass is required at all times. Day parking is free, but it's always better to carpool or take the shuttle.

Coachella involves long hours in the sun. Sunscreen is critical, and it is nearly impossible to drink too much water. If youâ€™re sensitive to the sun, consider a hat and light layers that will keep you covered.

The temperatures will be in the 90s, and there are thousands of people generating more heat and lots of sweat.

Festival rules prohibit bringing blankets, but carrying a small beach towel is smart. Other smart items to pack: ear plugs, chapstick, your own wipes and toilet paper (trust us), and cheap sunglasses.

Arrive early for everything you really want to see. Half an hour is a good general rule, but to see the most popular performances like Friday's Outkast reunion, you'll want to be there as early as you can. The last project that Big Boi and Andre 3000 did together was Idlewild in 2006.

7027615,Coffee Flour Upcycles the Waste From Your Favorite Java,"Two years ago, Dan Belliveau hit upon the idea for a new product: Coffee Flour(Opens in a new window). A former director of technical services at Starbucks, Belliveau had learned about coffee production while designing and building roasting facilities. The process, he realized, resulted in lots of waste, which could be used.

The dried, roasted coffee beans we use to make our java are actually seeds(Opens in a new window) that have been extracted from bright red fruit known as coffee cherries. Once farmers remove the beans, they are left with a huge amount of edible, nutrition-rich cherry pulp. In some countries the byproduct is dried and used to make tea, but, for the most part, it's simply discarded and left to rot. Suspecting there must be a better way, Belliveau took it upon himself to create a rudimentary coffee berry flour and began experimenting. ""My wife made some shortbread cookies and granola,"" he says. ""When it actually tasted good we thought, wow, we've got something here.""

Today, Belliveau's Vancouver-based startup, CF Global Holdings, has developed a patent-pending process for the milling of commercial-grade coffee flour. Gluten free, the product has three times more iron than spinach, three times more protein per gram than kale, and five times more fiber than whole grain flour, according to the company. ""Most flours are somewhere between 5 and 12 percent fiber,"" says Belliveau. ""Coffee flour is 55 percent fiber.""

The java flour doesn't taste particularly like coffee â€” it has a ""sweet, dried fruit flavor,"" says Belliveau â€” nor does it have much caffeine. To get a jolt equivalent to one cup of joe, a person would have to eat anywhere from seven to 16 slices of bread made with about 20 percent coffee flour. (To get a palatable consistency and texture, coffee flour is best used in combination with other grains.) Also, the edible caffeine product tends to have a slower, more sustained effect than liquid coffee.

With mills churning in several countries, CF Global plans to produce about 350,000 pounds of coffee flour this year. The startup received an undisclosed amount of funding from private investors and from industry giants Mercon Coffee and Ecom Coffee; Intellectual Ventures, a firm started by former Microsoft CTO Nathan Myhrvold(Opens in a new window), also invested and helped with the patenting process.

Belliveau says his process requires only minor tweaks to existing coffee manufacturing equipment and that farmers will profit while only expending about an extra 25 percent effort, since they already have the coffee waste on hand. CF Global hopes the added sales will help farmers take home an extra 30 percent to 50 percent of what they get from manufacturing coffee beans.",4/10/2014 0:00,0.751938,5,2,0,4.827338,10,Business,0,4751.629,2898.582,1600,0.305046,0.138731,0.043165,0.007194,0,0,2500

The man we're here to see, Winston Williams, is a few blocks north.

""I'm doing a U-turn. I'll be there in 20 seconds,"" he tells us over the phone, before abruptly hanging up.

Twenty seconds later, traffic be damned, a white van skids to the curb in front of us. Although nobody's in the back seat, the sliding door still opens. Winston's up front, smiling beneath thick dreadlocks and navy blue sunglasses.

""All right, guys. Get in.""

Winston has owned Blackstreet Van Lines, a commuter (or ""dollar"") transit service, since 2001. For $2, he'll pick up passengers anywhere on Flatbush Avenue, between Kings Cross and downtown Brooklyn. It's not a bus or cab service; it's not even affiliated with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA), New York's official transportation corporation.

In short, it's a bare-boned van service that runs through neighborhoods with poor access to the subway or bus.

[seealso slug=""iphone4-charging-cases/""]

Winston's particular company is one of many. Since the early 1980s, commuter vans just like it have sprung up across similar neighborhoods in both Brooklyn and its northern neighbor, Queens. More than 300 vans(Opens in a new window) are currently licensed in both Brooklyn and Queens.

They used to be illegal. After the New York City transit strike in 1980(Opens in a new window), which shut down all subways and buses for 10 days, residents in southeastern Brooklyn used their own vehicles to carpool riders into Manhattan. When the strike ended, the idea stuck -- much to the dismay of MTA employees, who felt the commuter vans were stealing their customers.

In the mid-1990s, advocates for the vans(Opens in a new window) pushed to make them legal, and the city eventually opened up an authorization process with the Department of Transportation. Now, anyone interested in authorizing commuter vans can go through the regular process of applications, hearings and insurance fees.

Most of the rules are the same: If you're a commuter van driver, you can't stop at bus stations or drive along bus routes, and you need a to provide a manifest of your stops to your customers.

As we accelerate, stop and honk down Flatbush Avenue, Winston points to a canvas rope attached to the sliding door's handle. It drapes across the back seat and up to the steering wheel.

""This is how I open and close doors for passengers from up here,"" he says. ""Not bad, huh?""

He stops a few blocks into our trip to pick up a passenger. The man, who asks to remain anonymous, is wearing dark sunglasses and holding two one-dollar bills in his right hand. We pick up three more passengers as we drive deeper into Brooklyn. Most are shy to speak, too -- understandable, given the two strangers greeting them with cameras from inside a narrow, 14-seater van.

A woman passenger, after chatting with the man in dark sunglasses, signals for Winston to let her out. As she leaves, the man turns to us with a cheeky grin.

7027589,Downloading Pirated Content Is Now Illegal in the Netherlands,"Downloading pirated content such as copyrighted movies or music is now illegal in the Netherlands, the Dutch Ministry of Security and Justice announced on Thursday(Opens in a new window). reports(Opens in a new window).

Until now, downloading copyrighted material in the Netherlands was permitted for personal use, effectively allowing Dutch citizens to download pirated content freely. The announcement comes after the European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruled(Opens in a new window) that a Dutch law that makes no distinction between personal copies made from legal sources and copies made from illegal ones ""cannot be tolerated.""

""The objective of proper support for the dissemination of culture may not be achieved by sacrificing strict protection of copyright or by tolerating illegal forms of distribution of counterfeited or pirated works,"" the court said in a press release(Opens in a new window).

Dutch citizens were allowed to download pirated content as long as it was to make copies of material they already owned (think of downloading The Dark Knight from The Pirate Bay to have a copy of the Blu-ray you purchased previously).

To compensate copyright holders, the Netherlands passed a law that, since January 2013, imposed a ""piracy levy"" on writeable media such as blank CDs and DVDs, hard drives and electronic devices with storage capacity. Importers of laptops, tablets, smartphones, and MP3 players have to pay(Opens in a new window) a 5 EUR copyright levy to the Dutch Home Copying Foundation, and the price of a blank CD or DVD includes 3 cents for the levy, according to Dutch News(Opens in a new window).

The ECJ ruled that this system is unlawful, and even unfair, as it makes people who do not download illegal material pay for those who do.

""All users are indirectly penalised since they necessarily contribute towards the compensation payable for the harm caused by private reproductions made from an unlawful source,"" the court wrote. ""Users consequently find themselves required to bear an additional, non-negligible cost in order to be able to make private copies.""

Following this ruling, the country's Ministry of Security and Justice announced that downloading pirated material is now effectively illegal. But it also specified that the ban is based on civil law, so infringers will not be prosecuted and will not face criminal charges, as reported by PCWorld(Opens in a new window).

The Dutch anti-piracy foundation Brein announced(Opens in a new window) on Thursday that it won't go after individual downloaders, but only sites and services that facilitate the access to illegal material.

7007790,"In Signing Climate Statement, Shell Charts Different Course on Global Warming","Faced with ominous scientific warnings on global warming caused by the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil and natural gas, two energy giants -- Exxon Mobil Corp. and Royal Dutch Shell -- have sent diametrically opposing signals in recent weeks.

Exxon, for its part, told its shareholders on March 30 that the company does not think that policies to address manmade global warming constitute a risk to the companyâ€™s profitability, because global policy makers are not going to enact strict emissions limits before 2040.

Instead, the company plans to exploit all of its remaining oil and gas reserves, as well as new discoveries, through 2040.

SEE ALSO: Carbon Dioxide Levels Climb Into Uncharted Territory for Humans

If this turns out to be the case, it would be a boon for Exxon, but a potentially disastrous scenario for the climate, based on the most recent scientific data showing that dramatic cuts in greenhouse gases are needed in the near-term to prevent the most dangerous global warming-related impacts, such as the collapse of land-based ice sheets in Greenland and parts of Antarctica.

Shell, on the other hand, decided to join more than 70 other companies, including Adidas and Unilever, by signing onto a non-binding document known as the â€œTrillion Tonne CommuniquÃ©(Opens in a new window).â€ The communiquÃ© is a project sponsored by the Prince of Walesâ€™s Corporate Leaders Group, which brings together business leaders to address climate change.

The document puts the signatories on the record as advocating for the development of ambitious greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets and timelines to bring global greenhouse gas emissions to â€œnet zeroâ€ by the end of the century.

â€œThis communiquÃ© sends a clear message from business at a critical time, when events in the Ukraine have refocused global attention on energy security, and just as the scientific consensus reminds us all of the imperative of collective action,â€ said Eliot Whittington, deputy director of the Corporate Leaders Group, in a press release.

In signing the communiquÃ©, Shell endorsed the idea of limiting cumulative greenhouse gas emissions to less than 1 trillion tonnes of carbon since the start of the industrial era, as recommended by the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in a report(Opens in a new window) released in September. This endorsement was a notable move for an energy company, considering that meeting that goal would put the companyâ€™s main sources of revenue at risk.

While Shell has been investing in alternative fuels like wind and biofuels, as well as advanced but so far unproven technologies like carbon capture and storage(Opens in a new window), most of its revenue still comes from its oil and gas operations. Its Arctic drilling activities(Opens in a new window) have drawn the attention of environmental groups such as Greenpeace, which has protested the company.

â€œWithout a clear and focused plan to manage our use of fossil fuels, we cannot achieve our target of keeping global cumulative emissions below a trillion tonnes,â€ says a frequently asked questions document accompanying the communiquÃ©.

â€œThe signatories to the communiquÃ© want a policy response to the risks posed by climate change,â€ the document says. â€œBusinesses that sign the communiquÃ© want to be a part of the solution in meeting this challenge and support a policy response at a sub-national, national and international level.â€

Kelly Levin, a senior research associate at the World Resources Institute in Washington, who has researched the implications of the IPCCâ€™s carbon budget, told Mashable that Shellâ€™s decision, along with the other companies that signed the communiquÃ©, is a positive sign. â€œI think it is quite significant that major businesses have come out to support what implies a 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) goalâ€¦ and in strong support of climate change science,â€ Levin said, referring to the goal of limiting global warming to no more than 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit above preindustrial levels.

The global average temperature has already increased by 1.6Â°F between 1901-2012, the IPCC said.

In signing the communiquÃ©, Shell did not commit itself to taking any actions to reduce its carbon footprint, and its move could be viewed as an attempt at ""greenwashing"" its image. However, despite the non-binding nature of the document, its actions sent a dramatically different message than Exxon's approach.

In two carbon risk reports(Opens in a new window), which were released on March 30, Exxon said it plans to exploit all of its massive oil and natural gas reserves -- both existing and future finds -- through 2040, which would emit at least 7 gigatons of carbon. (One gigaton is equal to 1 billion tons.)

This strategic planning decision amounted to a slap in the face of environmental advocates as well as scientists, who have said the world can only withstand a limited amount of additional greenhouse gas emissions before global temperatures increase to levels that would have a higher chance of destabilizing global ice sheets and raising sea levels high enough that adaptation would be nearly impossible.

In the first installment of its lengthy and highly technical fifth assessment report on the science of climate change, the IPCC found that, in order to have at least a 66% chance of limiting global warming to 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit or less compared to preindustrial levels, which world leaders agreed to(Opens in a new window) in 2009, the total cumulative emissions since the start of the industrial era would be limited to 1 trillion tonnes of carbon or less.

About half of this budget, or 531 billion tonnes of carbon, had already been used up by 2011, and significant near-term cuts in emissions would be required to stay within this budget going forward, the IPCC said.

Since a molecule of carbon dioxide can stay aloft for hundreds to more than a thousand years, it is the cumulative emissions since the start of the industrial revolution that will determine the amount of eventual global warming and the impacts of that warming.

According to a 2009 study(Opens in a new window), burning all proven and economically recoverable oil and gas reserves would put another 763 billion tonnes of carbon into the atmosphere. Because carbon dioxide is not the only global warming gas, the remaining carbon budget may actually be smaller than what the IPCC outlined.

If emissions continue to follow the current course, the world would exceed the IPCC carbon budget in as little as 30 years.

The IPCC said meeting the cumulative carbon budget would require having global emissions peak by 2020, and negative carbon emissions -- meaning more carbon is taken out of the atmosphere by plants and the oceans than is added by cars, trucks and factories -- would need to begin by 2090. A new section of the IPCCâ€™s voluminous fifth assessment report on climate science is due to be released on April 13, and it will provide more details about ways to reduce emissions to meet the 3.6 degree Fahrenheit temperature target.

Yet Exxon is making no plans to bring its operations into line with the global carbon budget, even in a non-binding way. In fact, its shareholder climate reports made no mention of the budget concept at all.

Instead, Exxon said it is prioritizing the need to meet the worldâ€™s growing energy demands through its oil and gas products, rather than addressing climate change, during the next several decades.

â€œAll of ExxonMobil's current hydrocarbon reserves will be needed, along with substantial future industry investments, to address global energy needs,â€ said William Colton, Exxon's vice president of corporate strategic planning, in a press release.",4/10/2014 0:00,0.598837,2,1,0,4.514286,6,00000,0,3914.417,2270.711,741,0.534497,0.115706,0.028571,0.005714,0,0,67700
7021445,Facebook Tweaks News Feed Algorithm to Combat 'Spammy' Posts,"Facebook is tweaking its news feed algorithm again, this time to combat posts that contains ""like-baiting,"" duplicate content and ""spammy links.""

Facebook says the algorithm change is in response to user feedback, and hopes to minimize the visibility of content the company considers ""spammy.""

[seealso slug=""facebook-news-feed-curation""]

Included as spammy are posts that include ""like-baiting,"" a strategy that actively encourages users to Like, comment, or share content with friends to boost its circulation. Posts with more Likes get more visibility, so posts that actively seek that kind of engagement from users are gaming the system, Facebook wrote in a blog post(Opens in a new window).

Facebook found that stories that utilize the like-baiting strategy are "" 15% less relevant"" than stories that achieve the same type of engagement organically.

Another type of content Facebook's algorithm will now identify are posts that include ""spammy links,"" or links that bring users to a website full of ads or highly circulated content they've already seen. Facebook identifies these links by examining how users engage with the post after clicking the link.

For example, if a user clicks a spammy link, they are less likely to Like or comment on the post as a result. This is a sign from Facebook not to surface that post to other users.

Facebook is known for continually tweaking its news feed algorithm, and this update joins a number of other major updates the algorithm has added in the last six months to try and clean up the content on news feed. In December, Facebook updated the algorithm to surface more ""high quality"" content from news organizations while minimizing the prevalence of memes on the platform.

In February, Facebook made a subtle change intended to help brand and celebrities achieve more reach on the platform by surfacing their content to users who are not active followers of their Page.

Thursday's change should not impact the majority of content publishers, the company wrote. (Unless, of course, they are posting spammy content.) In early tests, the company claims there has been an increase of 5% more link clicks that take users off Facebook.

In other words, the good content is more visible without all the spammy stuff getting in the way.",4/10/2014 0:00,0.564165,2,1,0,4.985646,6,Business,0,3601.16,2591.272,1700,0.486421,0.101563,0.035885,0.021531,0,0,1300

The FTC sent a letter to Facebook and WhatsApp outlining that Facebook will need to honor the customer privacy terms that the app currently has in place.

7007717,Investor Appetite Grows for Food Delivery Startups,"Investors are salivating over food delivery startups, at least judging from a series of funding announcements in recent weeks.

Munchery(Opens in a new window), a startup that provides same-day delivery for meals prepared by local chefs, announced Thursday that it raised a $28 million Series B round, bringing its total funding to date to about $35 million. The company intends to use the funding to expand its service to new cities beyond the Bay Area.

SEE ALSO: 10 Startups to Watch in 2014

The majority of the new round -- $25 million -- was contributed by Sherpa Ventures. Shervin Pishevar, the VC firm's founder, had pitched in for Munchery's seed round and Series A, and believes the company has the potential to be ""bigger than Chipotle,"" a bold statement considering Chipotle generated more than $3 billion in revenue last year.

""Munchery is growing incredibly fast in San Francisco. Customer acquisition is organic and viral,"" Pishevar told Mashable, noting that the startup's sales are growing at 20% month-over-month. He compared it to the growth trajectory of Uber, the multi-billion dollar taxi car company, which he invested in early on. ""I was able to calculate the city launches and the numbers get really big, really fast. The same thing is happening at Munchery.""

Talks for the latest funding round commenced 6-8 weeks ago, according to Pishevar, right around the time that GrubHub officially filed to go public. Even so, Pishevar says GrubHub's successful IPO played no role in driving up VC interest for Munchery. Instead, Pishevar argues that those in the food startup space have a similar potential to car services like Uber. Both, he says, are inherently social and are useful on a daily basis.

""What we look for are things where people need something multiple times a day,"" he says. ""Our prediction was the next Uber-like success would come out of the food market.""

Munchery is far from the only food delivery startup raising 8-figure funding deals. Sprig raised $10 million last month. Spoonrocket is reportedly(Opens in a new window) raising ""at least"" that much money. And Blue Apron is rumored to be raising(Opens in a new window) around $30 million at a $500 million valuation.

""I think people recognize that it's an industry that has yet to be really transformed by the Internet... which is one of the reasons that businesses like us and other different businesses in the food industry have been growing really fast,"" says Matt Salzberg, founder and CEO of Blue Apron. (He declined to comment on the rumors about Blue Apron funding).

Even those startups taking a different approach to the food delivery space are seeing strong investor interest. Kitchensurfing, which lets users hire private chefs to come to their homes and cook, announced raising a $15 million Series B round at the end of last month. The company is open to delivering prepared foods down the road, but not yet.

""The food space is very interesting because it has one of the largest share of wallets in the world in terms of how much people spend on food, and yet food has one of the lowest incidences of e-commerce penetration in the world,"" Chris Muscarella, cofounder and CEO of Kitchensurfing, said in an earlier interview with Mashable.",4/10/2014 0:00,0.388037,10,1,0,4.219605,5,Lifestyle,2742.174,4654.915,3679.388,0,0.481725,0.214547,0.067629,0.021277,0.85,0.45,6400
7027625,April's Total Lunar Eclipse Series Is Not the End of the World,"There has been a lot of interest recently in an upcoming series of lunar eclipses that begins April 15. These are usually described as ""four blood moons"" and taken by some to prophesy upcoming disasters.

The total lunar eclipse of April 15(Opens in a new window) will begin a so-called tetrad series of eclipses that is making the rounds online as a potential harbinger of doom, due in part to a recent book on the four blood moons that makes the dubious claim.

Astronomers rarely if ever use the term blood moon. When they do, they are usually using it as an alternate name for the Hunter's Moon, the full moon that follows the Harvest Moon, usually in late October. The Hunter's Moon, like the Harvest Moon, rises slowly on autumn evenings so that it shines through a thick layer of the Earth's atmosphere, and is colored red by Rayleigh scattering and air pollution.

Lunar eclipses explained

A lunar eclipse(Opens in a new window) is something quite different. It occurs when the moon passes through the Earth's shadow.

The Earth's shadow consists of two parts: a dark inner core called the ""umbra,"" and a lighter outer part called the ""penumbra."" Rather than being truly dark, the inner shadow is usually tinted orange or red by light passing through the ring of atmosphere surrounding the Earth.

Depending on the atmospheric conditions on Earth in the band of atmosphere through which the sun's light is passing, the umbra may take on a range of colors from light coppery-red to almost total black. The light illuminating an eclipsed moon is coming from thousands of sunsets and sunrises around the Earth. During some eclipses, these sunsets and sunrises are clear, and much light passes through; during others, clouds may block the light, causing a dark eclipse.

The blood moon

On rare occasions, the light reaching the moon is exactly the color of blood(Opens in a new window), but there is no way of predicting this in advance. So there are no grounds to call any particular lunar eclipse a blood moon until it actually shows its color.

Because the moon's orbit is slightly tilted with respect to the sun's path across the sky, most of the time the moon passes above or below the Earth's shadow, and no eclipse occurs. Sometimes it passes only through the penumbra and produces what is called a penumbral eclipse, a moon so lightly shaded that the casual observer might not even notice a difference. There were two such penumbral eclipses in 2013, on May 25 and Oct. 18.

Sometimes the moon only dips slightly into the central shadow, and it produces a partial lunar eclipse. One of these occurred last year, on April 25.

The rarest of all lunar eclipses are those in which the moon passes through the darkest part of the shadow, a true total lunar eclipse(Opens in a new window). This last happened on Dec. 10, 2011.

Four Blood Moons: The lunar eclipse tetrad

What is unusual about this month's lunar eclipse is that it is the first of a series of four total lunar eclipses in a row. Called a tetrad, such a series of four total eclipses in a row is a fairly rare event. The last such series happened in the years 2003 and 2004. It will only occur seven more times in the current century.

So while a tetrad of total lunar eclipses is somewhat rare, it is not extraordinarily so, and probably nothing to make a fuss about. After all, the only thing that happens during a lunar eclipse is that the moon(Opens in a new window) spends a couple of hours passing through the Earth's shadow, hardly something to be concerned about.

Unfortunately, there are still many superstitious people in the world. Such is the case in the book Four Blood Moons: Something Is About to Change (Worthy Publishing, 2013) by John Hagee, which suggests a link between the new total lunar eclipse tetrad and biblical prophecy about the end times.

When the mechanisms behind eclipses were less well understood, they were thought to be omens of bad tidings, just as comets were. Now people know that these are just normal events in the clockwork of the solar system, things which have occurred regularly for thousands of years and which will occur for thousands of years into the future.

Associations between ""disastrous"" events and normal astronomical events(Opens in a new window) are all fabrications of the human mind, as people attempt to find explanations for why disasters affect them. Because of the Internet and cable news channels, people now hear reports of disasters from around the world, including earthquakes, tsunamis and volcanic eruptions, which they never would have been aware of in the past. It's almost inevitable that something bad will happen right after an eclipse or a visit from a comet.

For ardent skywatchers who derive much pleasure from beautiful events like lunar eclipses, it's sad that there are ""prophets of doom"" in the world who view these life-enriching events as portents of disaster.",4/10/2014 0:00,0.608333,18,21,2,4.757333,8,Entertainment,3264.982,6063.895,4853.933,1850,0.526236,0.226156,0.058667,0.024,0.333333,0.25,1900

Fundbox(Opens in a new window) acts as a middleman between companies, decreasing the time it takes for invoices to be cleared by fronting the money owed. The company has been operating in a stealth mode while signing up thousands of businesses for its service and already handling tens of thousands of invoices per day, Fundbox claimed.

[seealso slug=http://mashable.com/2012/08/23/personal-finance-apps/]

The company acts as a microlender for small businesses that cannot afford to wait for money from clients that can often take up to 90 days to arrive. Fundbox identified this as an underserved space, in that banks tend to be reluctant to lend to small businesses, particularly in small amounts.

â€œWeâ€™ve identified an unprecedented opportunity to bring data-driven innovation to a critically underserved and broken market, focused initially on allowing small businesses to immediately clear outstanding invoices and improve cash flow by accelerating payments,â€ Fundbox founder and CEO Eyal Shinar said in a press release.

Behind the scenes at Fundbox is a complex system that calculates the likelihood of a business defaulting on a payment, combining behavioral analysis, finance theory and a wealth of data. This allows the startup to calculate the necessary fees on its short-term loans.

Business owners can directly connect accounting software to Fundbox to request microloans and track payments.

Once a loan is given for the invoice, the business can pay it back in installments or all at once without a penalty. The system also takes into account the frequency with which a business uses Fundbox and the reliability of its payments.

â€œEvery small business wishes for convenient access to capital at a fair price, but for most, that is just wishful thinking,â€ David Weiden, partner at Khosla Ventures, said in the press release. â€œFundbox leverages newly available cloud services and deep data science to deliver financial services that simply were not possible before, and that's the kind of innovation that can really build a great company.""

7021692,How to Succeed in Business Without Becoming a Workaholic,"I watched Wolf of Wall Street recently, which inspired several flashbacks to my days in finance, working in the pit for a large bank. Seeing those crowded trading desks and excited sales traders reminded me how hard most of those people worked to try to get ahead.

Probably too hard.

While Iâ€™m sure many firms dealing on Wall Street did their fair share of after-hours partying, I never saw it. Mostly because it seemed that hardly anyone ever left the office long enough to get up to much mischief. The first people in the office were almost always among the last to leave, and I remember witnessing more than a few contrite phone calls to spouses and loved ones, as my co-workers canceled on yet another dinner, birthday party, or family vacation. Sure, there was probably a lot of money on the table, but was working 18-hour days really the way to success?

Fortunately, I have also worked with a few successful people throughout my career who managed to keep climbing the corporate ladder without stomping all over their personal lives(Opens in a new window) in the process. Here are a few lessons Iâ€™ve learned from them over the years on how to achieve success at workâ€”without selling your soul.

Lesson #1: Gain a loyal following

Having co-workers, employees, or team members you can turn to at work is great for a lot of reasonsâ€”but itâ€™s also an ideal strategy for helping you accomplish more than you ever thought possible.

Take one of my old bosses, for example. She had worked for the firm for over a decade and knew everyoneâ€™s job inside and out. She was a great mentor(Opens in a new window) and easy to work with, and she always came to bat for us when we needed her.

As a result, the team was fiercely loyal to her. If one of us saw her staying late, weâ€™d ask her how we could help, so she could go home. If she had to give a presentation or leave town for a conference, a handful of us would jump to help her prepare or cover her workload while she was out. The team was so loyal to her that she rarely had to ask us to do anythingâ€”we almost always offered first. As a result, we were one of the most efficient, successful teams in our division, and no one had any doubt it was due, in large part, to our fearless leader.

Having loyal employees who will go above and beyond to help you is something you couldnâ€™t achieve on your own, no matter how many nights and weekends you worked. Yes, youâ€™ll have to put in some extra hours and effort up front, but once youâ€™ve proven yourself to your team, their loyalty will already begin to pay dividends.

Lesson #2: Outsource

This concept is nothing new, but for those of us with specific ideas on how a job should be approached, itâ€™s a difficult one to put into practice. But, ignore the benefit of outsourcing (or delegating) and youâ€™ll quickly find yourself burning the midnight oil.

Take my boss, a few years back, as a cautionary example. He was a perfectionist and had high standards for the work our team produced. Those high standards naturally rubbed off on the rest of the team, and before long, we were fully capable of performing all our duties to the highest standard. Unfortunately, our boss had a difficult time letting go and would often micromanage us so severely that he eventually just took over our projects himself. By the time he was finished, he was behind on his own work.

Thankfully, my boss eventually realized he had to start letting go(Opens in a new window). He started out by delegating the tasks he knew he couldnâ€™t finish, and before long, he was comfortable outsourcing larger projects. Once the work was more evenly distributed, he was happier at workâ€”and finally had the time to actually manage the team.

If youâ€™re starting feel like your work is taking over your entire life, itâ€™s probably time to start thinking about outsourcing some of your responsibilities. Start with smaller tasks, and gradually add more responsibility as you become comfortable with the results. Just make sure you donâ€™t micromanage the process, and before you know it, youâ€™ll have more time to focus on your professional growthâ€”and, youâ€™ll be a lot happier at work.

Lesson #3: Make a ""to-do"" and a ""done"" list

Iâ€™ve always been a big fan of lists, and theyâ€™re an especially important ingredient for attaining workplace success while minimizing your workload.

Not only do lists help you keep track of what you need to accomplish, but theyâ€™re also a great historical record of what youâ€™ve achieved. Iâ€™ll never forget a conversation I was having with a boss years ago, when he admitted he didnâ€™t really know what I did on a daily basis. I politely excused myself and ran to my desk and grabbed my trusty notebook. When I returned, we sat down, and I flipped through over a yearâ€™s worth of daily lists, detailing everything from large, long-term projects to daily deadlines. He was impressed with how much more I was doing, and when our year-end comp discussion rolled around a few months later, I had no objections to the raise I had asked for.

Lists will keep you organized and on track when youâ€™re overloaded with work, but more importantly, theyâ€™ll serve as a historical record of how awesome you are. And when you can point to a list that shows exactly what youâ€™ve accomplishedâ€”well, then youâ€™ll have to worry less about making sure your boss knows youâ€™re clocking 12 hours each day.

Lesson #4: Redefine â€œsuccessâ€

One of the saddest sights Iâ€™ve seen in my career is of an executive holed up in her office late at night on a Friday before a long weekend. There was no doubt sheâ€™d become a massive success at workâ€”but, well, that was about it. She worked tirelessly and never allowed herself any time for fun or relaxation. As a result, she was perpetually tired, and as far as the rest of the team could tell, she no longer loved the job sheâ€™d sacrificed so much for.

On the flip side, there was her colleague weâ€™ll call Betty. Betty was just as successful, however, she made a point to create and uphold strict work-life boundaries. During working hours, Betty was a machine. But, when quitting time rolled around, she was out the door(Opens in a new window) and never looked back. Management respected her efficiency, her team loved working for her, and her family still recognized her face.

In my book? Betty got it right. You probably canâ€™t enjoy your job if youâ€™re overworked and exhaustedâ€”and the more you enjoy your work, the better youâ€™ll be at your job. If you set boundaries, have a life outside of work, and take time to recharge whenever you can(Opens in a new window), youâ€™ll likely find youâ€™re much more productiveâ€”and successfulâ€”from 9 to 5.",4/10/2014 0:00,0.573913,7,1,0,4.985632,6,00000,0,3601.16,1824.324,687,0.40713,0.018806,0.022989,0.011494,1,0.125,6100

The fragment, known as the ""Gospel of Jesusâ€™s Wife,"" probably originated from Egypt.

It also mentions Jesus's mother and a female disciple, who may be identified as ""Mary.""

Now, James Yardley, senior research scientist in the Center for Integrated Science and Engineering at Columbia University, and Alexis Hagadorn, head of conservation at Columbia, used a technique called micro-Raman spectroscopy to determine(Opens in a new window) the papyrus fragment's age. Furthermore, Malcolm Choat from Macquarie University examined(Opens in a new window) the fragment's handwriting.

The discovery of the fragment is shrouded in mystery. The real author is not known, and the person who gave it to King in December 2011 wished to remain anonymous(Opens in a new window).

Since the fragment was unearthed, several scientists expressed their view that it is a forgery.

Sebelius is 65, and officials told the Times that she's stepping down of her own accord. But it can't have failed to escape anyone's attention that Sebelius presided over the disastrous initial roll-out of Healthcare.gov, the online insurance exchange mandated by the Affordable Care Act.

The site's open enrollment period ended last week, with more than 7.5 million U.S. residents newly signed up for health insurance.

7024511,Networking Equipment Makers Scramble to Patch Heartbleed,"It's not just websites that are vulnerable to Heartbleed. The OpenSSL encryption library at the heart of the massive Internet bug is in use other places, too -- including network hardware such as routers and switches.

Networking vendors Cisco, Juniper Networks, F5 Networks and Fortigate have all issued security alerts, disclosing that some of their products are affected by Heartbleed.

Cisco and Juniper both acknowledge that a range of products, including routers, firewalls and switches, are affected. Although most of these products are focused on corporate environments, some more consumer-oriented products could also be at risk.

As website administrators scramble to patch their apps and servers, IT and security admins are likewise trying to ascertain the potential vulnerabilities for network hardware.

In some cases, having vulnerable hardware could be just as bad -- or worse -- as having unpatched servers. With the right type of access and attack strategy, hackers could use the Heartbleed vulnerability to infiltrate a broader network.

Updates available by vendor

Mashable is trying to compile a list of companies that have issued security advisories or updates to their products.

The vast majority of these products are aimed at the enterprise level, not regular consumers or small businesses, but we'll add more information as we get more information from various vendors.

Synology(Opens in a new window)

NAS maker Synology has confirmed to Mashable that the software powering its devices is vulnerable.

The company is issuing an update on April 11 to address these problems.

Users running DiskStation and RackStation products running DSM 5.0 and DSM 4.3 should apply DSM 5.0-4458 Update 2 via the Control Panel. Users should also renew their SSL certification.

Users running DiskStation or RackStation products running DSM 4.2 can expect a patch next week.

Cisco(Opens in a new window)

Cisco is currently investigating its product line for affected products and will issue free software updates that address the vulnerabilities.

F5 Networks(Opens in a new window)

F5 Networks says that some of its virtual servers with a specific SSL profile are vulnerable. Management interfaces are also vulnerable.

The company has noted versions known not to be vulnerable on its website, and customers can upgrade to these versions.

Juniper Networks(Opens in a new window)

Juniper Networks has posted a list of vulnerable, not vulnerable and under-investigation products. It is working on providing fixed versions of code for its products as well as workaround solutions.

FortiGuard(Opens in a new window)

FortiGuard has issued a firmware update for its FortiOS. Firmware updates for FortiAuthenticator, FortiMail and FortiRecorder will be available on April 11. Firmware release dates for other products is pending.

Various workarounds are also available on the FortiGuard site.

Open-source router firmware

From what we can tell, most major consumer routers are not affected by Heartbleed. If you use the DD-WRT or OpenWRT open source router firmware packages, however, the version of OpenSSL on your device may be vulnerable.

DD-WRT(Opens in a new window) -- A popular open source router firmware, DD-WRT has been patched. See that forum thread for more information.

OpenWRT(Opens in a new window) -- The current version of OpenWRT has been updated with the latest OpenSSL fixes.

This could take time

A Juniper spokesperson told The Wall Street Journal that patching all of these products could take some time, saying, ""It doesn't sound like a flip-the-switch sort of thing.""

As for how many devices are potentially at risk, it's too soon to say.

7027445,The Programmer Behind Heartbleed Speaks Out: It Was an Accident,"The Internet bug known as Heartbleed was introduced to the world on New Year's Eve in December 2011. Now, one of the people involved is sharing his side of the story.

Programmer Robin Seggelmann says he wrote the code for the part of OpenSSL that led to Heartbleed. But it was an accident. He submitted the code to the OpenSSL project and other members reviewed it. Seggelmann later added another piece of code for a new feature, which the members then added. It was this added feature that introduced the bug.

[seealso slug=""heartbleed-bug-websites-affected""]

Seggelmann told the Sydney Morning Herald(Opens in a new window) that the actual error was ""trivial,"" but that its impact was clearly severe. Since he and the reviewers missed the flaw, it eventually made its way to the official release, which went live on Dec. 31, 2011, according to logs(Opens in a new window).

Heartbleed is a vulnerability in the encryption that many sites use to ensure that your communications can't be intercepted. Theoretically, up to two-thirds of the Internet traffic was exposed for more than two years. Engineers at security firm Codenomicon discovered the flaw(Opens in a new window) last week, and it was publicly announced on April 7.

As the name suggests, OpenSSL is open-source, which makes it attractive to many services, big and small, as an easily implemented security tool. Although anyone can contribute to OpenSSL -- either by contributing code or reviewing it to spot vulnerabilities like Heartbleed -- few actually do.

""It would be better if more people helped improving it,"" Seggelmann told Mashable via email. ""It doesnâ€™t really matter if companies benefitting from it provided some support, or if people do it in their spare time. However, if everybody just keeps using it and thinks somebody else will eventually take care of it, it wonâ€™t work. The more people look at it, the less likely errors like this occur.""

While standards exist for reviewing code, they are difficult to enforce for open-source software. To improve the process, Seggelman suggests having more peer review, although that would require more people contributing time.

""If more people participated in improving OpenSSL, it could be required to have multiple independent reviews for each submission or people could specialize in reviewing specific parts of the software,"" he said.

For now, most sites affected have patched the bug. But the emergence of Heartbleed puts a spotlight on where certain responsibilities lie with open-source software. As tools like OpenSSL become widespread, it can lead to a disparity between the number of services that use them and the number that actually contribute. As Heartbleed confirms, nothing is truly free.

7026927,Dangerous Tropical Cyclone Ita to Make Landfall in Australia,"Tropical Cyclone Ita, which surprised forecasters by rapidly intensifying into a fierce, compact storm that packs winds up to 160 miles per hour, is bearing down on the coast of northeastern Queensland, Australia.

With each successive forecast, the Australian Bureau of Meteorology's (BOM) projected storm track has come into closer agreement with the U.S. Navy's Joint Typhoon Warning Center. That spells trouble for the tropical resort city of Cairns, which is a gateway to the Great Barrier Reef and the lush forests of northern Queensland.

Infrared satellite image of Tropical Cyclone Ita as it approached the coast of Queensland on April 10, 2014. Credit:

According to the BOM, Ita is expected to make landfall between Cape Mellville and Cooktown as a Category Five storm on Friday evening, Australian time. The BOM issued a statement warning that the landfall area could expect gusts as high as 186 miles per hour, along with dangerous storm surge flooding.

Coastal residents between Cape Melville and Cape Tribulation including Cooktown are specifically warned of the dangerous storm tide as the cyclone crosses the coast later today. The sea is likely to rise steadily up to a level which will be significantly above the normal tide, with damaging waves, strong currents and flooding of low-lying areas extending some way inland. People living in areas likely to be affected by this flooding should take measures to protect their property as much as possible and be prepared to follow instructions regarding evacuation of the area if advised to do so by the authorities. Coastal residents between Cape Tribulation and Innisfail including Cairns should monitor the situation in case the cyclone takes a more southerly track than expected.

The storm is then forecast to weaken while curving south-southeastward, affecting Cooktown, Port Douglas, Cairns and Innisfail. The Typhoon Warning Center(Opens in a new window) predicts that the storm's center will strike land right over Cape Flattery, before lashing the coastal communities from Cooktown to Cairns with strong winds and potentially damaging storm surge flooding, before reemerging over the ocean on April 15.

The exact track of the storm has been difficult to predict in part because it is so compact, with the diameter of hurricane force winds (greater than 74 miles per hour) only reaching about 30 to 40 miles outside of the center of the storm. The storm's rapid intensification was not fully anticipated, either, and there are some indications that it may weaken some before coming ashore.

If it fails to weaken significantly, it would become one of the most intense storms on record to hit Queensland.

In general, forecasters have more success predicting a storm's track than changes in its intensity, largely due to a lack of observational data from within the core of a storm. Computer models don't yet take all the key factors governing storm strength into account, and often lack the resolution necessary to capture small-scale developments in a storm as small as Ita is.

In the U.S., the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has been conducting research(Opens in a new window) to change that within the next few years, with modest successes seen so far.

At its peak intensity, Tropical Cyclone Ita exceeded the strength of Tropical Cyclone Yasi(Opens in a new window) which struck Queensland in 2011, causing $3.6 billion in damage. That storm was the costliest in Australia's history.

Ita could be more costly than Yasi, depending on its ultimate track and intensity. One concern is that the storm may slow down once it makes landfall, which could yield dangerously high rainfall in a state that has already had a number of of flooding events in recent years.

A tropical cyclone is the same type of storm as a hurricane, but these storms are referred to differently throughout the world. In the north Pacific, for example, they are known as typhoons.

In Australia, meteorologists use a different standard than the U.S. does for measuring tropical cyclone sustained winds, relying on a 10-minute wind reading, rather than the 1-minute average that the U.S. uses. The country also uses a slightly different ratings scale that has a lower threshold for a Category Five storm than the Saffir-Simpson scale that Americans are accustomed to.

According to Climate Central(Opens in a new window), when its winds are compared to the Saffir-Simpson strength scale used in the North Atlantic basin, Ita ranks as a Category Four storm, while the BOM ranks it as a Category Five storm.

Regardless of the standard used or storm type that is cited, Ita is an unusually potent storm that could do enormous damage.",4/10/2014 0:00,0.477064,4,2,0,4.845638,6,Business,0,4740.153,2536.546,14600,0.430478,0.127533,0.044743,0.013423,0.45,0.25,2500

7007513,New Australian Crayfish Is a Tiny Cannibal,"A new species of crayfish discovered in southeast Australia's coastal lakes and swamps is one of the world's smallest crayfish species, researchers report.

The tiny, blue-black crustacean resembles its larger cousins that end up in cooking pots, such as lobsters and crawdads. But this species, which locals call a lake yabby, measures only 0.5 to 0.7 inches long. The biggest one found was just 0.8 inches long, and weighed 0.2 ounces.

Despite its small size, the yabby is a powerful burrower, riddling its swampy habitat with burrows up to 3 feet deep. The burrows reach down to the shallow water table, and help the crayfish(Opens in a new window) survive dry stretches -- Australia's coastal swamps regularly drain and dry up, then flood with up to 5 feet of water. Thick grasses and reeds in the swamps and lakes provide protection for the petite crayfish, which is prey for eels, birds, fish, lizards and turtles.

The freshwater species was named Gramastacus lacus, which refers to its favored habitat in ephemeral waterways such as Wallis Lake, Wamberal Lagoon and Myall Lake, which periodically flood and dry, reports Robert McCormack, a lead biologist with the Australian Crayfish Project. McCormack described the new species in a report published April 4 in the journal ZooKeys(Opens in a new window).

In his report, McCormack also suggested replacing the common name of lake yabby with eastern swamp crayfish instead.

Males of the new species grow bigger than females, but both sexes have long claws called chelae that they wave in defense when menaced by other crayfish or predators (these crayfish are cannibals).

Because of their giant claws, crayfish are more nimble in the water than on land. The newly found swamp crayfish has a unique walk when out of water, McCormack wrote. It travels forward via a series of rhythmic plunges, raising its claws and upper body with its legs, then plunging down and forward like a swimmer doing the butterfly stroke.

Beginning Thursday, LinkedIn says it will start surfacing jobs openings from a user's current company. For example, an Apple employee seeking new work on LinkedIn will also see job openings within Apple.

It's a way for companies to retain talent -- and should help employees who like their company, but maybe not their job, explains Barrile.

Users will now see internal job openings on the â€œJobs You May Be Interested In"" section of the site, and LinkedIn is using its algorithm to surface relevant jobs outside a user's current department. For example, a public relations employee may see job openings in marketing.

The algorithm works to identify ""transition patterns,"" or common jumps between industries that would make sense for employees, says Barrile.

7007433,We're Getting Close: Another Signal Detected in Malaysia Plane Search,"Search teams in the southern Indian Ocean have detected yet another signal that authorities hope is coming from the black boxes on Malaysia Airlines Flight 370.

That makes five distinct signals in just a few days, narrowing the search area even more for teams who have been combing the seas for more than a month.

""The acoustic data will require further analysis overnight but shows potential of being from a man-made source,"" said Australia's Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston, in reference to the most recent signal.

Thursday's search area is smaller -- about 22,400 square miles, or roughly the size of West Virginia, as CNN notes(Opens in a new window) -- as teams think they're getting closer to what may be MH370's final resting place.

This latest signal was picked up near the Australia's Ocean Shield ship that detected the other signals, which is significant because that means they're all coming from the same area.

Underwater search teams picked up two distinct signals yesterday: The first lasted 5 minutes, 32 seconds; the second was 7 minutes. They were within the confines of an area that's less than 1,500 miles from Perth.

After this week's discoveries, authorities are growing more confident that they're zeroing in on Flight 370, which went missing on March 8 with 239 people on board.

""I'm now optimistic. We'll find the aircraft or what's left of the aircraft in the not too distant future,"" Houston said Wednesday.

After chasing down several dead-end leads over the past month, authorities approached the first rounds of signals with skepticism because marine life can sometimes emit similar sounds. However, experts analyzed the first two signals that were detected over the weekend and determined that they were, in fact, from a manmade device and not nature.

If teams recover the plane's black boxes, it will be nothing short of a miracle. For one, time isn't on their side. Batteries in the flight recorders last only 30 days. As of Thursday, the plane has been missing for 34 days.

Although the search area is now smaller, teams are still up against depths that plunge nearly 3 miles. To put that into perspective, just take a look at this Washington Post graphic(Opens in a new window).

7027296,NASA Starts Building Asteroid-Bound Spacecraft,"NASA gave the go-ahead to start construction of the first asteroid-bound spacecraft on Wednesday, which is scheduled to launch from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida during the Fall of 2016.

OSIRIS-REx will land on an asteroid named Bennu, which comes close to Earth in 2018. The spacecraft will spend a year exploring the asteroid, and will bring about two ounces of soil samples back to Earth.

SEE ALSO: Solar Flare Captured in Stunning NASA Video

Dante Lauretta, a planetary science professor at the University of Arizona who is serving as principal investigator for the mission, told Mashable that there has already been a decade's worth of planning just to get to the point where they were ready to build the spacecraft, and that the timeline from here on out is ""perfect.""

Part of that planning involved selecting the best asteroid. â€œThereâ€™s something like 700,000 asteroids in the solar system,"" Lauretta said, ""and we had to pick one to send a spacecraft to.""

First, the team eliminated asteroids that were too far away to be practical. That got the number down to a few hundred. Then, they looked at the size. The team wants the craft to have room to roam, and smaller asteroids spin so quickly that a landing would be almost impossible, so they looked at asteroids with a 200-meter diameter.

The science team told Lauretta and company that they were also searching for a carbon-rich space rock that might be able to help them understand how an asteroid could have given rise to life on Earth. That led them to Bennu.

The asteroid is on the opposite side of the sun right now, but its orbit takes about 1.2 years -- meaning it crosses Earth's orbit once every six years. Bennu actually has a 0.0005% chance of hitting our planet in 2018, according to Lauretta.

That might seem like a minuscule number, but it's a lot closer than the vast majority of asteroids in our solar system ever get.

The mission is meant to help NASA better understand asteroids, and to help determine which ones might be suitable for future landings. ""The initiative brings together the best of NASAâ€™s science, technology and human exploration efforts to achieve President Obamaâ€™s goal of sending humans to an asteroid by 2025,"" the space agency says.

If the schedule doesn't run into any hiccups, OSIRIS-REx should be back on Earth by 2023.

Superstars such as Portugal's Cristiano Ronaldo, Argentina's Lionel Messi and Neymar from Brazil can't be matched in terms of skill, pace or goal-scoring ability at the game's highest level.

But when it comes to inspiring stories, not even the world's biggest stars can match the soccer journey of a 19-year-old named Nico Calabria.

[seealso url = ""http://mashable.com/2014/03/30/world-cup-usmnt-mls-players""]

Born with just one leg, Calabria got his start in the sport at an early age. Despite the fact that the beautiful game revolves around the lower limbs, Nico played varsity soccer for his high school and scored a goal that became a viral highlight.

There was also the time when, at 13(Opens in a new window), he became the first person to scale Mt. Kilimanjaro on crutches, while raising more than $100,000 for charity in the process -- but we're here to talk about soccer.

Now Calabria is a member of the USA's national amputee soccer team, and the subject of a mini-documentary (embedded above) that was produced by Powerade and was scheduled to show at the Kicking + Screening(Opens in a new window) Soccer Film Festival in New York on Thursday night.

The film doubles as a branded Powerade spot, but it's inspiring stuff nonetheless, and an amazing window into Calabria's story.

Growing up in Indianapolis, Ind., and Concord, Mass., Calabria says it took years to realize that the active lifestyle he enjoyed as a kid -- and excelled at -- was anything out of the ordinary.

""I've always been part of a family that's athletic, and had an older brother who was very athletic, so I was just trying fit it and didn't think I was doing anything abnormal,"" Calabria tells Mashable.

""But over the years I just kind of continually surprised myself with the level I was able to compete at.""

Onward and upward

In middle school, Calabria says, he never expected to make his high school's freshman soccer team. But he did. As a freshman, he never expected to make varsity. But he did.

Then, in one varsity game during his senior year, Calabria, while using the crutches that let him move about the field, scored an incredible over-the-head goal off a corner kick that went viral. Here's the play, which has been viewed 1.7 million times since hitting YouTube on Sept. 20, 2012:

That goal caught the attention of Powerade, among other companies. With the Kicking + Screaming festival on Powerade's radar and Nico exemplifying just the type of inspirational stories of real athletes the brand wanted to be associated with, everything came together.

It turned out there was a lot of material to work with. Whenever each of his three kids had a birthday growing up, Calabria's father Carl would interview them on camera. He was also obsessive about recording their daily activities. (""My sister has the most footage because she was the cutest,"" Nico says.)

A World Cup of his own

After the festival on Thursday, the two-minute version above will become part of a global Powerade ad campaign centered around the World Cup (Powerade's parent company, Coca Cola, is a sponsor of the tournament).

Life will go on for Calabria, too. He graduated high school in 2013 and took a year off from school to intern with SideStix, the company that makes his crutches, and teach gymnastics to kids. In the fall, he starts at Colorado College, where he plans to ask if he can practice with the soccer team to stay sharp.

In November, he'll don the red, white and blue to represent the USA at the Amputee Football World Cup(Opens in a new window), which takes place in Mexico this year.

""I'm just honored to be a part of this and help tell my story,"" Nico says.

6646707,11 Times We've Seen the Real Stephen Colbert,"Who exactly is the real Stephen Colbert? Many fans have started to ask this question after CBS confirmed Thursday that Colbert would succeed David Letterman as host of The Late Show in 2015.

There have been two Stephen Colberts for years, beginning with his tenure as correspondent at The Daily Show with Jon Stewart. Ever since, Colbert has walked a fine line between the man and the character. On one side is the staunchly patriotic and ill-informed loud mouth that the Colbert nation has come to adore and on the other is the liberal arts graduate and improv actor who just wants who make people laugh -- the real Stephen.

[seealso slug=stephen-colbert-late-night-questions/]

While the host has softened his alter-ego after the #CancelColbert scandal a few weeks ago, he still remains ultimately professional while hosting his current show, The Colbert Report. Even though he rarely breaks character on the show, there have been many moments where we've been able to see a glimpse at the real Stephen.

6885647,"RIP, 'Stephen Colbert'","The faux fireplace that scantily warms the set of Stephen Colbertâ€™s The Colbert Report features a saying engraved in the wall above it: videri quam esse, Latin for â€œto seem, rather than to be.â€

Itâ€™s a play off the Latin phrase esse quam videri (â€œto be, rather than to seemâ€). The engraving is said to be a tip of the hat, and a wag of the finger -- to borrow a phrase -- to the hostâ€™s hyper-conservative, Geraldo Rivera-cum-Bill Oâ€™Reilly, all-about-me mock personality.

Itâ€™s a personality Americans -- at least the liberal, young and overwhelmingly male viewers that make up his audience(Opens in a new window) -- have grown accustomed to. And itâ€™s a personality that will die at the end of this year when the Report ends its run and Colbert prepares to take over the Late Show.

â€œI wonâ€™t be doing the new show in character, so weâ€™ll all get to find out how much of him was me,â€ Colbert said in a statement.

In case youâ€™ve been left out of the joke all these years, let me say it: Stephen Colbert isnâ€™t ""Stephen Colbert."" Stephen Colbert, the man, has been playing ""Stephen Colbert,"" the character, ever since his meager beginnings on Comedy Centralâ€™s The Daily Show, playing with his God Machine(Opens in a new window) and arguing with Steve Carrell.

â€œIâ€™m insincere on the show,â€ Colbert once told Tim Russert in an interview(Opens in a new window) about the Report. â€œI just say things I donâ€™t mean.â€ He spoke of dialing the characterâ€™s traits up and down on a â€œsliding scale.â€

Watch the clip, and youâ€™ll see it. Heâ€™s there, but itâ€™s not him.

The real Colbert who's expected to grace the set of the Late Show may prove to be a major risk factor for CBS, which is hoping The Colbert Reportâ€™s younger, dedicated demographic will follow him when he leaves Comedy Central for the late-night slot on broadcast television.

Viewers may tune in expecting to see the greatest satirical comedian of the past 20 years, and instead find a sincere, nice, clever man -- but not the Colbert they know and so dearly love.

If thatâ€™s how this thing will unfold, one of two things may happen.

One: Colbert moves on, and his audience does too. Those who propelled him to fame early on will stick with Comedy Central, or move on, and find a new comedian to welcome into their homes. His new fans on CBS will be older, more traditional, less ideological. Theyâ€™ll find him funny, heâ€™ll find himself comfortable, and like Jay Leno and even David Letterman himself, Colbert will slowly rot out in the stage light.

Two: Colbert thrives. He brings his sharp wit, his biting satire, and his stellar interview skills that have left politicians withering in the hot seat and his audience doubled-over in laughter. His audience will follow, theyâ€™ll grow, and CBS will win on both fronts. The showâ€™s success will ring in a new age of late-night television, bridging the gap between Letterman's generation and Colbert's.

Weâ€™re pulling for that one. At least he'll keep the name.

Either way, itâ€™s a sad day for late night television watchers to lose such a fantastic satirical character who pulls in millions of eyes week after week.

As we witness the death of Colbert, the character, hereâ€™s hoping CBS doesnâ€™t strangle Colbert, the man. At least they should pony up for a dentist.

â€œIâ€™m thrilled and grateful that CBS chose me,â€ Colbert told the world in a statement announcing Thursdayâ€™s big news. â€œNow, if youâ€™ll excuse me, I have to go grind a gap in my front teeth.""

The images, which were taken in late March, have spurred worry amongst NATO and its allies that Russia could invade Ukraine at a moment's notice. The alliance has given Breedlove until Tuesday to come up with a plan that answers Russia's military buildup and that will demonstrate NATO's support of Ukraine.

""Essentially what we are looking at is a package of land, air and maritime measures that would build assurance for our easternmost allies,"" Breedlove said(Opens in a new window) of his plan-in-progress. ""I'm tasked to deliver this by next week. I fully intend to deliver it early.""

Russian news outlet RT, however, reports that the images were taken last summer. DigitalGlobe, however, tells Mashable it can confirm that the dates in the AP report of March 2014 are accurate.

7027137,The Social TV Revolution Isn't Here Yet,"Twitter mentioned the word ""television"" more than 40 times in the paperwork it filed to go public last year, and for good reason. The social network has doubled down on product updates and acquisitions to ensure that it becomes the second screen for TV viewers.

Likewise, Facebook has tried to take a page from Twitter's playbook and partnered with a social TV analytics group -- one that Twitter later acquired -- to show off how its massive user base engages with and discusses television shows.

Both social networks are vying for a piece of the lucrative TV ad budgets, but as one new survey shows, Twitter and Facebook still have a long way to go to become part of the mainstream TV consumption experience.

Some 16% of online Americans currently use social media while watching primetime TV, according to a survey(Opens in a new window) of nearly 1,665 individuals for the Council for Research Excellence conducted by Nielsen. Yet only 7.3% of primetime viewers actually use social media to talk about the TV show they are watching at that moment.

Despite making a later push into social TV, Facebook performs slightly better on this front. Some 3.8% of primetime viewers in the study used Facebook to talk about the show they were watching at that moment compared to just 1.8% for Twitter.

Credit:

The study found that those who engage on social media about the shows they're watching tend to be more likely to binge watch programs and consume TV shows on tablets and smartphones. On the whole, though, the takeaway is that social media is far down on the list of factors driving viewers to watch new shows.

Commercials and traditional promos were the top factor with nearly 40% of those surveyed saying this led them to watch a new show. By comparison, just 6.8% of respondents cited social media, making it less effective in the eyes of viewers than ""I flipped channels and came across it.""

7026242,"Colbert Was CBS' 'Late Show' Guy Since 2012 -- And Yes, He'll Keep the Name","Stephen Colbert will end The Colbert Report when his contract expires at the end of 2014, take a break, and start gearing up to take over The Late Show most likely in the fall of 2015 -- capping an informal succession plan that's been in motion going back as far as December 2012, Mashable has learned.

And thereâ€™s no need to switch to an Americanized pronunciation of his name: Colbert wonâ€™t go back to KOHL-bert, but will keep the soft-ending kohl-BAYR, which he took on back in college. It was a personal choice -- not as part of any schtick -- and he's not the only member of his family to use the more French-leaning pronunciation.

But Colbert will definitely leave the ego-charged pseudo-conservative personality behind. How he does it will be fun to watch: With eight months left of his Comedy Central show, Colbert will have plenty of time to orchestrate his own demise, so to speak, sources close to the show tell Mashable.

""I won't be doing the new show in character, so we'll all get to find out how much of him was me. I'm looking forward to it,â€‹â€‹"" Colbert said in a statement emailed to Mashable.

Will â€œStephen Colbertâ€ the character be killed off outright? Will he be subsumed into Stephen Colbert the man? You can bet Colbertâ€™s creative talents will be maxed out for the transition -- and seeing as CBS and Comedy Central are close corporate cousins, theyâ€™ll have some wiggle room to play with the transition.

Letterman announced last Thursday that he was retiring, with the timetable TBD. The following day, Mashable first reported that Colbert was CBSâ€™ first choice, and that the Colbert Report host was interested in taking the job.

On Thursday, CBS made it official with a statement that Colbert had signed a five-year contract. Several media outlets quoted network executives saying the deal came together quickly after Letterman's retirement, including breakneck negotiations with several candidates.

But individuals close to the succession plans tell Mashable that Colbert and CBS began talking as early as December 2012 about him taking over The Late Show upon Lettermanâ€™s retirement. At that point, the timing was still a big unknown -- throughout the process, the network was determined to let Letterman go out on his own terms and at a time of his choosing. Though Colbert and the network never entered into any formal discussions until after Letterman's announcement, a handshake deal was made: CBS wanted Colbert, Colbert was stoked to succeed Letterman, and the rest would be worked out later.

The network still entertained calls from interested parties -- the chatter among the broadcast community was that Jon Stewart was once considered for the job, but he ultimately faded out of the picture. Over the past few years, The Daily Show gained prominence (most watched in late night among the 18-49 demographic), and Stewartâ€™s other interests -- he just finished directing his first feature film -- began to make a five-nights-a-week network gig look time-prohibitive.

It's been said that Colbert has been synching his contract to match up with Letterman's; there may be some truth in that. But Colbert re-upped with Comedy Central in July 2012 to run through 2014, several months before Letterman signed a one-year contract in October of last year. If that maneuvering was indeed purposeful, it worked out.

Craig Ferguson, whose Late Late Show comes on after Letterman's, was never seen as a true contender for the slot; it remains to be seen whether heâ€™ll stick around at CBS after being passed over. Other names thrown in the mix were Chelsea Handler and Neil Patrick Harris -- but even as top contenders, they were dark horses at best. For nearly 18 months, Colbert was CBS' guy.

One of Colbert's priorities was sign-off from Letterman, whom he deeply admires. The two are friendly -- Colbert has been a regular guest on the Late Show -- and the two had a conversation several weeks ago about a possible transition. It went well, and in a subsequent conversation after Letterman's announcement, Dave gave Stephen the blessing he'd sought.

Letterman kept his final broadcast date vague, but itâ€™s likely to happen around October 2015, around the end of one broadcast season and the beginning of a new one. That gives Colbert less than a year between the end of The Colbert Report and a reboot of The Late Show, which is in all probability staying in New York, as Colbert has deep family ties on the East Coast.

But Colbert wonâ€™t likely wait until the end of 2014 to start noodling on the concept of his new show -- when weâ€™ll finally get to see the man behind the persona. Before Colbertâ€™s ascension was made official by CBS, that man got one big endorsement from his buddy and lead-in man Stewart.

â€œHeâ€™s done an amazing job with just that very narrow cast of character, but heâ€™s got a lot more he can show,â€ Stewart told Vulture(Opens in a new window) for a story posted early Thursday. â€œHeâ€™s got some skill sets that are very applicable, interviewing-wise, but also heâ€™s a really, really good actor and also an excellent improvisational comedian. Heâ€™s also got great writing skills. Heâ€™s got a lot of different capacities. Being able to expand upon (those) would be exciting.""

7007279,"Stephen Colbert Is Taking Over for David Letterman, CBS Confirms","Stephen Colbert will succeed David Letterman as host of The Late Show, CBS confirmed Thursday, the last piece of a wholesale late-night overhaul that's nearly a decade in the making.

Mashable first reported last week that Colbert was the network's top choice for the role, and that the host of The Colbert Report was interested in taking the job. Colbert is expected to drop the pseudo-conservative persona he's created on the Comedy Central show when he moves to CBS, sources tell Mashable.

Colbert will start his run after Letterman's retirement -- which has no timetable other than it will happen sometime in 2015 -- with a five-year contract, CBS said in a statement Thursday morning.

â€œSimply being a guest on David Lettermanâ€™s show has been a highlight of my career,â€ Colbert said in the joint statement. â€œI never dreamed that I would follow in his footsteps, though everyone in late night follows Daveâ€™s lead. ... Iâ€™m thrilled and grateful that CBS chose me. Now, if youâ€™ll excuse me, I have to go grind a gap in my front teeth.â€

The network said specific creative elements, producers and location for the show were not revealed.

â€œStephen Colbert is one of the most inventive and respected forces on television,â€ said CBS head Les Moonves. â€œDavid Lettermanâ€™s legacy and accomplishments are an incredible source of pride for all of us here, and todayâ€™s announcement speaks to our commitment of upholding what he established for CBS in late night.â€

The late-night landscape appears to be settled for the time being, depending on whether Craig Ferguson decides to stay in his post-Late Show spot after being passed over for the job. Sources tell Mashable that while Ferguson is well-liked and considered solid in his later spot, he was never really a contender to succeed Letterman.

Jimmy Fallon and Seth Meyers are NBC's new one-two punch in late night after both took on respective new spots earlier this year. Jimmy Kimmel Live has been steadily building its audience since the show debuted on ABC in 2003, just a few years after Jon Stewart took over The Daily Show on Comedy Central.

Colbert's takeover of The Late Show could set up years of stability in the late-night landscape, provided he and all those mentioned above continue to find an audience in the increasingly crowded (and shrinking) space.

The next big question is: Who gets Colbert's slot? Comedy Central has shown it can compete with the networks with its potent two-hander of Stewart and Colbert, and would most likely move to keep that momentum. John Oliver would've been considered a frontrunner after successfully filling in for Stewart, but he's taken his talents over to HBO.

Fall is just a junior, according to the recruiting site 247Sports(Opens in a new window), so he has a year to improve on those numbers and impress college coaches. But given his remarkable height (he would be the NBA's tallest player if he joined the league today), Fall should have no trouble finding a college program willing to take a chance on him.

7007021,Coming to a Couch Near You: A New Wave of Telecommuting,"If you get a job at Automattic(Opens in a new window), you don't have to worry about moving. Hell, you don't even have to get out of bed.

The company, best known for WordPress.com(Opens in a new window), is completely distributed, meaning its 230 employees work from home. Or they can work from home. Matt Mullenweg, the CEO of Automattic, notes that the company has a physical headquarters in San Francisco. ""Well, you've got to have somewhere TO get mail,"" he explains. While a handful of employees work in the San Francisco office, the rest are flung across 170 cities. ""It allows you to get the best and brightest people in the world,"" Mullenweg says. Automattic gives its employees a monthly stipend of $250 to get a co-working space if their home office situation isn't great. As an Automattic employee, you also get up to $3,000 to set up your home office.

Not far from Automattic's San Francisco office are some of the world's biggest tech companies -- Apple, Google, Yahoo. None of them share his vision of a distributed company. Apple is built on a culture of secrecy that views working remotely as an unnecessary risk. Google provides free meals to persuade employees to stay at company headquarters all hours of the day. Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer famously required telecommuting employees to start coming into the office in 2013 in order to foster a culture of innovation.

Other distributed companies like GitHub, WooThemes, Mozilla and Upworthy are outliers. In 2014, despite advances in technology over the past few decades and the ubiquity of broadband, full-time telecommuters are a tiny minority. That may be changing, though, as a new wave of distributed companies challenge the status quo.

The telecommuting concept

In the early 1970s, Jack Nilles, a rocket scientist at NASA was contemplating the next big challenge for mankind.

""One regional planner said 'If you can put a man on the moon how come you can't do something about traffic?'"" Nilles recalled recently. ""The proverbial light went off in my head.""

Nilles solution was telecommuting, a term he is credited with coining in 1973. Reasoning that many people on the road were traveling to and from jobs, Nilles decided to address the necessity of commuting. In that pre-PC era, ""telecommuting"" had a different meaning. Nilles' first telecommuting project was with an insurance company that was looking to increase its employee retention rate. Rather than let them work from home -- which was impossible back then -- the company set up satellite offices. Employees could then walk, bike or take the bus to go to work.

The introduction of PCs was a ""eureka moment"" Nilles recalled. Now, those same employees didn't need to commute at all, but could do their jobs from their homes, in their pajamas if they wished. In the ensuing three decades, the technology that allows for telecommuting has gotten better and better. In 2014, you can videoconference, share documents and collaborate in real time from your PC, tablet or phone.

Yet very few people work from home full-time.

In 2012, just 2.9. million people, 2.6%(Opens in a new window) of the U.S. employee workforce worked from home full-time. Some 50 million employees had jobs that were telework-compatible, according to Global Workplace Analytics.

The group claims that if all those employees worked from home just 2.4 days a week for a year, then the reduction in greenhouse gases (51 million tons) would be equivalent to taking the entire New York workforce off the roads. Great damage to the environment could be avoided if more people worked from home and if more businesses let them, but that's not happening because of managers' fear and mistrust and current gaps in technology. As the latter improves, though, managers may begin to get more comfortable with letting their employees work remotely, even full-time. New companies could also be completely distributed and lack a physical headquarters, saving overhead costs.

Media richness theory

On the other hand, consider serendipity. If you put dozens or thousands of creative people under one roof, a few might connect and create something that they wouldn't have thought of if they stayed home in their pajamas. It's a sort of riff on the Infinite Monkey Theorum(Opens in a new window), which states that if you put monkeys in a room for a long enough time, they'll produce Shakespeare.

""We do our best work when weâ€™re physically connected,"" says Roy Hirshland, CEO of T3 Advisors, a commercial real estate advisor. Dialing in on Skype will work in a pinch, but it's not a substitute, he says. ""When you're in the same room, you can see facial expressions, you can feel energy in a room.""

The idea is based on Media Richness Theory, which posits that some tasks require face-to-face interaction. Skype doesn't fit the bill. ""Skype is a great, free way to communicate with sound and picture, but with glitchy connections, awkward camera angles, the limitations of webcams and cheap microphones, etc.,"" says Dr. Matthew Lombard, a professor at Temple University and president of the International Society for Presence Research. ""It's far from the same experience as talking to someone in person. Face-Time and other tablet and phone methods have the advantage of mobility, but they suffer in terms of the vividness of the experience.""

""Narrow-bandwidth tech like text-based chat rooms and messaging, and email, are great for specific, relatively straight-forward, 'dry' cognitive tasks but not so good for things that involve ambiguity and emotion,"" Lombard says. ""So there are an awful lot of tasks people need to complete in business (and certainly in life generally) that don't lend themselves well to these technologies.""

A more negative slant on this is that managers don't trust their employees. ""The C-Suite largely 'gets' the business case for telecommuting, but middle managers are largely resistant. Why? Because they simply donâ€™t know how to manage,"" says Kate Lister, president of Global Workplace Analytics. ""They mistake presence for performance. If they can see the back of someoneâ€™s head, they assume that person is working.""

In business circles, this is known as ""managing by walking around."" Lister says that's a 20th Century construct. ""If managers are not managing by results or outcomes, they're not managing, they're babysitting,"" she says.

Mullenweg agrees. ""It's easier to slack off in that office than if you're working remotely,"" he says. ""If you come into an office and are well-dressed and on time, you assume people are working because they look busy. At home, all you have is your output -- did you commit the code, did you write the post, did you make the proposal? There's no theater of physical proximity.""

Some studies also show that remote workers are more productive. Chinese travel site Ctrip, for instance, found employees that worked from home made 13.5%(Opens in a new window) more calls than workers in the office did. Such workers also reported higher job satisfaction than their office-bound cohorts. A Brigham Young University study also found that office-based workers found it hard to manage their work and home life after logging 38 hours in a week. For telecommuters, the limit was 57 hours.

Distributed companies

Some entrepreneurs, like Mullenweg, see telecommuting employees as an untapped resource and have launched distributed companies. While no one tracks the number of such companies, FlexJobs(Opens in a new window), a site that lists telecommuting and flexible hours jobs, saw a 98% increase in job postings from 2012 to 2013. Brie Weiler Reynolds, director of online content at FlexJobs, says she still thinks that telecommuting jobs are ""in the small minority.""

WooThemes(Opens in a new window), which makes WordPress plug-ins and themes, is an almost-distributed company. Thirty-seven people work for WooThemes and are flung across the world. However, the company does have a nine-person office in Cape Town, South Africa. Mark Forrester, co-founder of WooThemes, says having such a structure can be difficult.

""Being distributed doesnâ€™t come without itâ€™s fair share of compromises,"" he says, noting that tax paperwork is particularly tricky when your staff are all based in different countries. Communication can also be a challenge. ""A text conversation can often be misconstrued, so we try and jump on a regular Google Hangout with team members to get some face to face time. These hangouts are hugely valuable as well as entertaining. We also try to meet up once a year as a team -- somewhere new and different. These trips increase in cost as our team grows, but we see both huge tangible and intangible benefit from them.""

Like WooThemes, Automattic also organizes trips a few times a year so employees can have some face time. ""What we save on office space we blow on travel,"" he says. Employees get to pick the location of such semi-yearly conferences. Once there, they get to know each other better, Mullenweg says. ""We do some things like ideation and brainstorming that work better in person,"" he says. ""We don't need to do this every day.""

There are other ways to promote a corporate culture without physical closeness. Reynolds says her company, which is itself distributed, hosts online yoga sessions and uses social media to foster a corporate culture. ""We use Yammer as our watercooler,"" she says. ""We post pics of our dogs dressed up for Halloween."" Reynolds says she believes there's nothing preventing a distributed company from being as big as Google. ""As long as you're really thinking about corporate culture and looking for a way to build your workforce,"" she says. ""It's really that forethought that makes a company reach that level.""

Jeff Atwood, the CEO of Discourse(Opens in a new window) says that savvy startups are realizing the advantage of using telecommuting as a recruiting tool. ""There's a lot of talent that's is very, very untapped,"" he says. ""Tapping that talent is a strategic advantage.""

7007139,'Sims' Meets 'Animal Crossing' in Nintendo's Next Handheld Game,"If you've ever wanted to scoop up all your friends, family and favorite celebrities and force them to dance, sing, fall and love and fight for your amusement, Nintendo's got your number in its new handheld title Tomodachi Life.

Tomodachi Life, out June 6 for the 3DS and 2DS handhelds, gives players their own island and tasks them with filling it up with Nintendo Mii versions of everyone they know. These Miis will run around the island autonomously, but players can check in on their activities throughout the day and interact with them.

The Tomodachi franchise was started by Nintendo in Japan as Tomodachi Collection, released in 2009. That game sold 5 million copies, and caused NIntendo to spend considerable time localizing and ""culturalizing"" the game for the West, a Nintendo rep told Mashable.

The game feels like a cross between The Sims and Nintendo's own Animal Crossing. You'll be able to completely personalize up to 100 characters, setting their appearance and personality type. The personality attributes picked then affect how that Mii interacts with others on the island, as well what types of food and clothing they like.

While players don't control what the Mii characters do, they can see when they are unhappy and want their needs met. It could be as simple as feeding them, though each character has their own favorite and hated foods. They also will want new outfits from the island's many shopping options that rotate stock daily, to play one of 10 mini-games with you, and to be introduced to friends. They'll even ask for advice if they want to ask someone out.

Drama is possible in Tomodachi Life, especially when you get to watch two of your friends fall in love, or a third person get involved, but with a lighthearted, silly tone There are also plenty of funny possibilities: there are daily events like rap battles between residents, and you can teach characters different styles of singing for a karaoke session.

If you see a particularly funny moment, taking a screenshot of either of the 3DS' two screens is easy. Tomodachi Life integrates with Tumblr, Facebook and Twitter so users can quickly share photos of their Miis in action to their social accounts.

If filling the game with your friends wasn't enough, Nintendo is also partnering with some celebrities to include their likenesses as downloadable characters. The first will be Christina Aguilera, though Nintendo said it is finalizing contracts with others.

7024155,U.S. Regulators Warn Banks About Heartbleed Bug,"U.S. financial regulators expect banks to patch their systems to protect against the Heartbleed security bug, according to an alert sent to banks Thursday.

The Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) warned that the bug could have exposed their networks to hackers, and saying they needed to patch their encryption software and ""strongly consider"" requiring their users to change their passwords, according to The Wall Street Journal(Opens in a new window).

""Attackers could potentially impersonate bank services or users, steal login credentials, access sensitive email, or gain access to internal networks,"" read the alert, according to the WSJ.

The FFIEC also said it expects ""financial institutions to incorporate patches on systems and services, applications, and appliances using OpenSSL,"" according to a press release(Opens in a new window).

Heartbleed is a security flaw found in the popular web encryption software OpenSSL, which is used by around two thirds of websites on the Internet to protect information sent and received by users connecting to it. The bug potentially exposed all kinds of sensitive information on vulnerable websites.

Gmail, Yahoo, and Facebook were affected by Heartbleed before they issued a patch. The bug was exposed on Monday, but it has apparently existed since 2012 -- meaning anyone who had found the flaw could have exploited it for some time.

Mashable has compiled a list of popular sites and services that might have been affected by the bug and have patched it.

7026917,Weather Service: Please Disregard Our Giant Biblical Flood Warning,"NOAA, meet Noah.

The website for the National Weather Service (NWS), which is part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), suffered a major malfunction on Thursday leading to the false appearance of a biblical flood warning spanning from Canada (which the NWS doesn't even have responsibility over) south to Florida, and west to Michigan.

The malfunction, which began around midday ET and was fixed by 3:15 pm ET, affected local NWS websites -- key conduits for disseminating life-saving watches and warnings.

The false alarm led to one tweet from the National Weather Service forecast office in Boston, which may prove to be one of the greatest dispatches in the history of the NWS.

Please disregard the giant flood warning presently across the entire Eastern U.S. We are currently experiencing webpage issues.â€” NWS Boston (@NWSBoston) April 10, 2014(Opens in a new window)

In Boston, as well as New York City, the NWS websites showed a major flood warning in effect, yet skies were clear and conditions were so dry that a brush fire was burning in Edison, N.J., southwest of the city.

The situation was even more confusing in the Southeast, which experienced widespread flooding over the weekend. River flood warnings were still in effect in Alabama and other states, but it was difficult to pick those out from the maps on the NWS websites -- since they were covered in the green hue of NOAA's mysterious flood.

According to NWS spokeswoman Susan Buchanan, the website issue was traced to an incorrect coding within a real flood warning issued by a local NWS office. ""One of our forecast offices issued a flood forecast with a corrupted latitude/longitude string, which caused the incorrect display of our national hazards map on weather.gov. The problem was brief, and has been fixed,"" she told Mashable in an email.

The latest website problem comes a week after NWS websites experienced server problems as a tornado outbreak got underway in the Mississippi River Valley. Those problems prevented some users from accessing NWS websites.

Humans are accustomed to drawing in the air. We gesture with our hands when talking and will try to illustrate charade secrets by ""drawing"" objects in space. 3D-printing pens takes those gestures, makes them tangible and, in the hands of an artists, beautiful. Recent 3D-printing pens have been cool, but clunky affairs. LIX Pen, however, is something different. It's light, small and apparently needs no more power than you can draw from your run-of-the-mill laptop. Now it's coming to Kickstarter.

Believe it or not, someone at LIX drew this figure with a 3D-printing pen. Credit: LIX

Measuring 6.45 inches long, 0.55 inch in diameter and weighing just 1.23 ounces, the aluminum 3D-printing pen (which also comes in black) really is pen sized. You hold it just like a pen, and plug a 3.5mm-like jack into the base and the other end of your cable into your computer. The juice allows LIX to heat to over 300-degrees Fahrenheit, though the plant-based PLA filament (it can also use the stronger ABS plastic) only needs to heat to 180-degrees to work. That filament is fed in through a hole in the base and emerges as a super-heated liquid on the tip so you can start doodling in the air.

Not sure these 3D-pen-printed designs are usable, but they are pretty to look at. Credit: LIX

Unlike 3D printers, there is no program guiding the printing tip. Instead, to create 3D objects, you simply start drawing in the air with the LIX Pen, moving slowly as the melted filament draws out. It cools quickly so that your structure remains rigid. Each filament rod is about 10 centimeters long and should, according to the company, last for about two minutes of air-drawing.

3D pen printing works for everything from abstract sculpture to fine art and jewelry to T-shirt design. The only limit, it appears, is your skill level and ability to hold and move the pen very, very steadily.

LIX co-founder Anton Suvorov, told Mashable the company's 3D-printing pen ""has no concurrence on the market,"" and it should arrive in Kickstarter sometime around April 14, where the company will be taking pre-orders. The starting price, at least for the campaign, will be $139.95.

7026876,"YouTube Remains Blocked in Turkey, Despite Court Order","YouTube remains and will remain blocked in Turkey for the time being, even though a court ordered the government to unblock the video-sharing website on Wednesday.

The Turkish telecom regulator, the Information and Communications Technologies Authority (BTK), announced on Thursday that it will not lift the ban until ""criminal content"" is removed from YouTube, according to various news(Opens in a new window) reports(Opens in a new window). The BTK is ignoring the court order, so the timeline for lifting the ban remains unclear.

""The measure blocking access to the youtube.com Internet site remains in place,"" BTK said in a statement on its website, according to Hurriyet Daily News(Opens in a new window). ""Some content in 15 links was removed, but YouTube blocked some other content only for Turkish users while leaving it open to other countries. Since March 27, a total of 151 links have been located on the website broadcasting the same criminal content.""

The criminal content is likely referring to videos deemed insulting to Mustafa Kemal AtatÃ¼rk, the founder of the Turkish Republic. The YouTube ban, ordered by the government on March 27, was later confirmed by the Ankaraâ€™s GÃ¶lbaÅŸÄ± district court, citing a law that makes it illegal to insult AtatÃ¼rk.

This is the latest in a seemingly endless back-and-forth on the YouTube ban.

Last week, a court issued the first ruling ordering the ban to be lifted, but later on the same day a higher court reversed the order after an appeal by the Turkish prosecutor.

Turkey blocked YouTube after an anonymous user posted leaked recordings of an alleged high-security meeting among Turkey's intelligence chief, the foreign minister and the deputy head of the armed forces, during which they discussed potential military operations against Syria. The leak was the latest in a long string of leaked wiretaps posted on the site, which allegedly uncovered corruption within the government of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip ErdoÄŸan.

The YouTube ban came just a week after the Turkish government banned Twitter, as ErdoÄŸan announced his intention to ""eradicate"" the social network completely.

Turks found several ways to circumvent the Twitter ban, though, sending a record number of tweets just a few hours following the block.

A lower court ordered the government to lift the Twitter block on March 26. But the social network remained blocked until April 3, when the country's Constitutional Court ruled that the Twitter block violated Turks' free speech rights and ordered the government to unblock it immediately.

The YouTube ban is likely to go all the way to the Constitutional Court, too.

7006938,Scientists 3D Print a 'Tumor' of Cancer Cells,"Using 3D printing, researchers have made a tumor-like lump of cancer cells in the lab, and they say this lump shows a greater resemblance to natural cancer than do the two-dimensional cultured cells grown in a lab dish.

This more realistic representation of a tumor could aid studies on cancer and drug treatments, the researchers said.

To build the tumor-like structure, the researchers mixed gelatin, fibrous proteins and cervical cancer cells, then fed the resulting mixture into a 3D cell printer they had developed. Layer by layer, the printer produced a grid structure, 10 millimeters in width and length, and 2 millimeters in height.

That structure resembles the fibrous proteins that make up the extracellular matrix of a tumor, the researchers said.

The cells were then allowed to grow, and after five days, the growth took on a spherical shape. The spheres continued to grow for three more days.

The cervical cancer cells used by the researchers were HeLa cells(Opens in a new window), the ""immortal"" cell line that was originally taken from a cancer patient, Henrietta Lacks, in 1951. HeLa cells can multiply indefinitely and are the most common type of cells studied in cancer research.

In general, cancer studies involve cancer cells grown in the lab, which help scientists better understand the behavior of these abnormal cells. New cancer drugs are usually tested on such cells, in the lab, before being evaluated in human studies. Therefore, 2D models of cancer that consist of a single layer of cells grown in a dish have been created to assist research and testing of new drugs.

However, compared with such 2D cell cultures, the additional dimension of a 3D culture(Opens in a new window) better reveals the tumor cells' characteristics, including their shape, their proliferation, and gene and protein expression, the researchers said.

""With further understanding of these 3D models, we can use them to study the development, invasion, metastasis and treatment of cancer using specific cancer cells from patients,"" said study researcher Wei Sun, a professor in the department of mechanical engineering at Drexel University, in Philadelphia.

7006964,Al Jazeera America Announces First Layoffs Since Launch,"Al Jazeera America has initiated its first round of layoffs since its launch, with its social media-focused show The Stream and its sports division taking the brunt of the cuts.

The layoffs were widely reported in the ""dozens,"" but a source at Al Jazeera America indicated that the number of staffers eliminated was fewer than 100. In addition to the staff cuts, a number of freelancers were also let go, who were said to be the majority of the layoffs.

The cuts mark the first large-scale contraction from Al Jazeera America since its launch in August. The channel has struggled to attract viewers(Opens in a new window), including reports that its ratings have come in below those of its former home, Current TV.

Kate O'Brian, president of Al Jazeera America, informed staffers in a memo of the move.

""We have reached what I will call our steady-state level of operations and we are bringing our staffing levels into alignment with our long-range plan as per our original business case. As a result, certain parts of our organization will expand or contract and staff levels and resources will be recalibrated,"" O'Brian wrote.

She also noted that the total number of staff at the company would remain more than 800.

Dawn Bridges, executive vice president for corporate communications at Al Jazeera America, told Mashable that the move had followed on the channel's efforts to get up and running and no other large-scale layoffs were expected.

Al Jazeera America launched in early 2013 after the Al Jazeera Media Network, the multimedia conglomerate owned by the government of Qatar, bought Al Gore's Current TV. The company then aggressively recruited journalists, hiring 689 employees that joined the 200 remaining from Current TV, according to a New York report(Opens in a new window) from July.

Below, Kate O'Brian's full memo to staffers:

Dear Al Jazeera America Colleagues,

As we prepared for our launch over the past year we set ambitious and aggressive goals. In the seven months since launch we have built a channel that it took other networks years to do. As you all know, that required extensive effort, planning and resources. We always understood that we would need considerable resources to meet our goals. We never wavered in our commitment because we knew that a surge in our capacity was essential to a successful launch of Al Jazeera America.

As a result of this extensive planning and investment, we met our own deadlines. We should all be very proud of what has been built in such a short time. Now it is time to set our sights on new goals, requiring different levels and areas of investment and resources. We have reached what I will call our steady-state level of operations and we are bringing our staffing levels into alignment with our long-range plan as per our original business case. As a result, certain parts of our organization will expand or contract and staff levels and resources will be recalibrated.

This will have an immediate impact on some staff, freelancers, independent contractors, and other project-oriented individuals who have been with us for several months. Those that are effected have been sent a note with information on meeting their supervisors and HR representatives later today. These colleagues have provided a valuable service to us for which we are deeply grateful.

On behalf of the entire senior management team, Iâ€™d like to thank our departing staff and freelancers for all the work they did to get AJAM up and running.

7026685,"'Allegiant' to Be Split Into 2 Films, Copying 'Hunger Games' Again","It didn't seem possible, but the Divergent series has found yet another way to crib off The Hunger Games.

Allegiant, the third book in Veronica Roth's derivative young adult trilogy, will be split into two films, Summit/Lionsgate announced Friday. That's exactly what the studio did for the Twilight series and Hunger Games (and the same as Warner Bros. did for Harry Potter and The Hobbit).

The final two Allegiant films starring Shailene Woodley as Tris (the Katniss Everdeen character) will be released March 18, 2016 and March 24, 2017, respectively. Divergent scored a $54.6 million domestic opening in March, and is up to $139 million worldwide in three weeks. That's a less-than-spectacular result, but good enough to justify the further extension of the franchise.

Summit/Lionsgate first caught the double-dip bug when it turned the fourth Twilight Saga book into two films; the finale grossed more than $800 million worldwide. The studio followed that up by announcing that Mockingjay â€“ third in the Hunger Games series that clearly inspired Divergent â€“ would be sliced neatly into two films.

Of course, to hear Lionsgate executives tell it in their statement Friday, Allegiant is so epic that it warrants two films on creative merits alone.

â€œVeronica Roth brings her captivating story to a masterful conclusion in Allegiant, a rich, action-packed book with material that is ideally suited to two strong and fulfilling movies,â€ said Lionsgate motion-picture group co-chairmen Rob Friedman and Patrick Wachsberger. â€œThe storytelling arc and world of the characters lend themselves perfectly to two films.â€

The case has alarmed media watchers, who worry the government is returning the Burmese press to censorship levels last seen under its previous military rule.

Pe, who worked for the Democratic Voice of Burma (DVB), received a conviction for ""disturbing a civil servant"" and ""trespassing,"" according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. The case stemmed from an attempt by Pe, who was accompanied by Win Myint Hlaing, the father of a student, to interview an education official.

The official then lodged a complaint against Pe and Hlaing. Earlier this week, a court found Pe guilty and sentenced him to one year in prison(Opens in a new window).

7026904,Heartbleed Fallout Continues: Canada Orders Shutdown of More Gov't Sites,"After shutting down its online tax-filing services on Tuesday, Canada is taking further precautionary measures against the Heartbleed Internet security bug. The country is ordering various government agencies to temporarily shut down affected sites.

The chief information officer for the Canadian government sent a directive to all government departments late on Thursday to ""immediately disable public websites that are running unpatched OpenSSL software,"" according to a statement(Opens in a new window) by the President of Canada's Treasury Board.

""This action is being taken as a precautionary measure until the appropriate security patches are in place and tested,"" the statement read.

It's unclear which websites will be disabled, as the statement only refers to ""certain Government of Canada websites."" The Treasury Board said it was a necessary step to ensure Canadians' privacy.

""We understand that this will be disruptive, but, under the circumstances, this is the best course of action to protect the privacy of Canadians,"" the statement read.

Heartbleed is a bug in the popular open-source encryption software OpenSSL, used to secure data flowing from users' computers to hundreds of thousands of websites. According to estimates, almost two-thirds of all sites use OpenSSL, making this bug one of the most dangerous the Internet has ever seen.

OpenSSL has contained this bug for two years, but security researchers uncovered it only last week. Details were first published(Opens in a new window) on Monday, prompting many sites to rush to fix their servers. The bug potentially allows hackers to access all kinds of sensitive data, such as passwords or credit card numbers on websites that are supposedly secure. However, there is no proof that hackers discovered the flaw and exploited it before the researchers uncovered it.

Many websites patched the problem quickly, while others are still fixing their systems. Many, including Facebook, Instagram and Pinterest have asked users to change their passwords. Mashable is continuously updating a list of popular social media, banking, commerce and other sites that were vulnerable.

The full statement from Canada's Treasury Board is below:

Earlier this week, an Internet security vulnerability named the Heartbleed bug, caused by a flaw in OpenSSL software was detected. OpenSSL is a commonly used software used on the Internet to provide security and privacy.

The Heartbleed bug is affecting many global IT systems in both private and public sector organizations and has the potential to expose private data.

This evening the Chief Information Officer for the Government of Canada issued a directive to all federal government departments to immediately disable public websites that are running unpatched OpenSSL software. This action is being taken as a precautionary measure until the appropriate security patches are in place and tested.

As a result, Canadians will be unable to access certain Government of Canada websites while measures are being applied.

7006828,Two U.S. Soccer Stars Each Make More Than 15 MLS Teams,"Clint Dempsey is a damn fine soccer player, but is he this good?

Dempsey, who returned to Major League Soccer (MLS) from the English Premier League in August, is making $6.695 million in guaranteed salary for the Seattle Sounders this year.

If that seems like a lot of money for an America soccer player, you're right -- Dempsey's salary is more than the total payroll of 15 of the 19 MLS clubs.

[seealso url = ""http://mashable.com/2014/03/30/world-cup-usmnt-mls-players""]

We know this because the MLS Players Union released payroll figures(Opens in a new window) for the league on Thursday. Dempsey is the league's highest-paid player, followed by Toronto FC's Michael Bradley and Jermaine Defoe.

Dempsey, Bradley ($6.5 million) and the Los Angeles Galaxy's Landon Donovan ($4.6 million) are the only U.S. Men's National Team (USMNT) members among the league's 10 highest-paid players(Opens in a new window).

Bradley, like Dempsey, also earns more than then entire payroll of 15 of the 19 MLS teams. Even Donovan's relatively humble salary is higher than 12 teams' payrolls.

If you're wondering how such a big pay disparity can exist in a league with a hard salary cap of $3.1 million per team, it's thanks to the MLS' ""designated player rule."" The rule allows teams to sign up to three players whose salaries don't count against the cap.

The idea is to help the league increase its talent level, but still maintain some competitive balance.

Here are the 2014 salaries of several other players who will likely represent the US at this summer's World Cup and play pro ball in MLS:

Omar Gonzalez, L.A. Galaxy: $1.25 million

Graham Zusi, Sporting Kansas City: $398,250

Eddie Johnson, DC United: $613,333.33

Matt Besler, Sporting Kansas City: $200,000

Kyle Beckerman, Real Salt Lake: $378,750.00

The process of finding that show may mirror the short-leash experiment the network tried when The Colbert Report debuted in October of 2005, with no more than an 8-week commitment. Had Colbert fizzled, the network could've bailed; but execs knew within just a few days that they'd captured lighting in a bottle.

Can they do it again? And on the first try?

Comedy Central won't be afraid to try out different people and formats on short-term basis like it did with Colbert, people familiar with Comedy Central's thinking told Mashable. And though eight months isn't a huge amount of time to fill shoes as big as Colbert's, it's enough that the network isn't rushing a decision.

One thing is for certain: Comedy Central is gunning for some kind of replacement to debut shortly after the character addresses the Colbert Nation one last time. The network plans to make a move, and has no intention of throwing in a placeholder to buy time.

By no means is Comedy Central hellbent on capturing another newsy yang to Stewart's yin. I was surprised to learn that Chris Hardwick's comedy quiz show @midnight into Colbert's slot is under serious consideration, not because the show isn't doing great -- it is -- but because it's doing so well in its existing slot. Why mess with success? (Not to mention the fact that you'd need to change the show's name.)

The more exciting prospect is for Comedy Central to fashion something that's entirely new, but still sews up the 11 p.m.-midnight hour as a solid block for the young, socially savvy audience it already owns in late night. Even if the network does settle on a hosted talk-show format, it certainly has a good stable of existing and outside talent to draw upon.

Whichever way Comedy Central goes, here's a bet I'll go on the record with: It will involve some kind of social-media interactivity, a la @midnight, whose ""hashtag wars"" has become a nightly show of its own on Twitter.

It's not just websites and routers that are vulnerable to the web-wide bug Heartbleed -- certain Android models are at risk too.

As Google noted in its own Heartbleed disclosures(Opens in a new window) on Wednesday, Android devices running Android 4.1.1 Jelly Bean are vulnerable to Heartbleed. Google said patching information is being distributed to its Android partners.

So how many phones are still running Android 4.1.1? That's difficult to determine. Although 34.4% of Android devices(Opens in a new window) are running Android Jelly Bean, Google doesn't break out how what percentage of users are on its various versions -- 4.1.1 and 4.1.2.

The latest version of Jelly Bean is 4.1.2, which was released in October 2012.

A Google spokesperson confirmed to Bloomberg(Opens in a new window) that there are ""millions"" of devices running Android 4.1.1.

Because Android updates are controlled by phone manufacturers and wireless carriers, it can be challenging to determine what versions of Android are available for various devices.

The security firm Lookout has published a list of the most popular devices(Opens in a new window) still running Android 4.1.1.

The include:

HTC One S

HTC One X

HTC Evo

Motorola Atrix HD

Heartbleed underscores what has long been one of Android's biggest problems: pushing out software updates to its myriad vendors. Android updates are the responsibility of the device maker, and often need to be approved by wireless carriers. The only exceptions are Google-made devices, such as the Nexus series and Google Play Edition phones.

Previous attempts at getting phone manufacturers and carriers to adopt Android updates have not met with success. If there is a silver lining to Heartbleed, it is that this might scare device makers into pay more attention to versions (and to put in better processes for security updates).

If you know your Android device is running Android 4.1.1, let us know the model and manufacturer in the comments, along with your wireless carrier.

We stigmatize Theodore Twombly, Joaquin Phoenixâ€™s character in the movie, Her(Opens in a new window), as morally questionable when falling in love with his operating system, yet donâ€™t find it adulterous when the last face we look at before falling asleep belongs to our smartphone versus our soulmate.

Itâ€™s time to come to grips with what it means to be human in a digital environment. That is, a fully digital or virtual environment. We can talk about unplugging from technology, but that behavior is more akin to minimizing an activity window while our relationship continues running in the background of our lives. Sensors in our phones and the innards of our globe monitor ubiquitously, broadcasting our unencrypted consciousness to the world.

[seealso story=""2014/04/07/twitter-use-divorce""]

Itâ€™s hard not to get philosophical. Or judgmental -- Iâ€™m genuinely struggling with the idea that weâ€™ll soon fully merge with machines.

As technology gains human level sentience, I need to evolve my mindset. What if my daughter wants to marry an algorithm? Can I have dinner with its parents? Can we expect to see anti robot-bullying campaigns soon? Or a reworked cover of Macklemoreâ€™s, â€œSIM love?â€

I joke because Iâ€™m conflicted. Iâ€™m genuinely a bit freaked at the idea that humans and machines are already so inexorably linked. And I firmly believe that things like the wearables industry are simply intermediary technologies to mentally prepare us for our inevitable union with machines. They help reveal the personal data thatâ€™s currently invisible in our lives while providing a thin, albeit fashionable, buffer between the time devices will be on our skin versus within.

My goal here is to confront my unease with this union while my identity is largely located in my cortex rather that the cloud. Iâ€™m not anti-robot, as I thought I might be in the past. But the reality of transcendence with technology shouldnâ€™t be taken lightly, even if it is inevitable.

The resolve to evolve

â€œWhat it means to be human and the evolution of humanity is changing so rapidly that weâ€™re kind of at a different stage of being human. Thereâ€™s not a lot of distinction between the natural and artificial any more,â€ says Colin Marchon(Opens in a new window), an NYU student and documentary filmmaker.

We met at the recent Augmented World Expo(Opens in a new window) in Brooklyn where I was on a panel discussing the future of Augmented Reality. Colin, 20, is currently working on a thesis film called The Transhuman Identity(Opens in a new window) to be completed in late 2014. He grew up in Silicon Valley with parents in the tech industry. Already active on messaging boards by age seven, he noted in our interview that heâ€™s part of the first generation to have all of his life take place alongside, or within, the Internet.

â€œIâ€™m used to experiencing my life being almost fully documented and my kids could have access to my entire history since I was a teenager,â€ Marchon said. In my experience, my younger friends and relatives are way more savvy about their privacy and digital lives than my friends who are over thirty. It makes sense that overtly merging with technology would not be as freaky to them as it is to me and my peers.

The nature of intimacy is evolving along with technology. Do you raise your eyebrows at friends who met via a dating service? I did the first time a friend told me she met her lifeâ€™s love in an old-school, AOL-era chatroom. I thought it was remarkably mature that they dated via phone and computer for months without meeting in person, but felt it was a risky trend at the time. Now I donâ€™t.

""What does it say about how weâ€™re evolving, that more women would rather give up sex than their iPhones?â€ asks Ramona Pringle(Opens in a new window), an assistant professor at Ryerson Unversityâ€™s RTA School of Media, and the director and producer Avatar Secrets(Opens in a new window), an interactive iPad experience exploring the complexities of human connection in the wired world. The quote is from a survey(Opens in a new window) of more than 3,500 women where 48% said their smartphone was more important to them than intimacy with another person.

Where at first glance it may seem callous for these women to prefer silicon to sex, who are we to judge?

Perhaps soon weâ€™ll get used to people declaring overt relationships with their smartphones, which will make texting your lover into something akin to a Jean Paul Sartre play. What if you have to carry a different device at work than your personal device? Will your mobile lover get jealous? Maybe start hitting on your Nest(Opens in a new window) while youâ€™re at work?

â€œWe talk about the future as if these robotic devices are going to be â€˜other,â€™â€ noted Pringle in our interview, in terms of how we see robots or technology as fundamentally separate from ourselves. But like most of us, she reports her iPhone could only be closer to her if it was embedded under her skin.

â€œOur phones are already becoming part of us. I rely on mine for everything, even knowing all the phone numbers of everyone I love that I donâ€™t have memorized. So in essence, Iâ€™m the one becoming more of a robot, or cyborg, as my day to day life increasingly relies on this technology, and my next of kin becomes this mobile phone,â€ she said.

[seealso story=""2014/04/02/wearable-tech-improving-lives""]

For myself, I barely remember my home phone number and would certainly be dead in the water to call my kidsâ€™ school or a local hospital if I couldnâ€™t access my contacts or the Internet. If 911 werenâ€™t only three numbers I likely would have forgotten it already.

The logic of the loss

â€œItâ€™s counterintuitive in many ways, that as these services and devices improve and embed themselves deeper into our lives we notice them less.â€ Patrick Tucker(Opens in a new window) is the author of, The Naked Future: What Happens in a World That Anticipates Your Every Move?(Opens in a new window), technology editor for Defense One and editor-at-large for The Futurist magazine.

The book describes the idea of telemetry, and how the real-time conveying of signals, as in the case of multiple sensors being applied to our bodies in a hospital setting, is transforming our present age into the Naked, or purely visible, Future.

In our interview, I asked if the nature of this algorithmic lifestyle would rob us of anything central to our humanity. While Tucker feels we have yet to encounter a technology that has made this happen, he pointed out that, â€œOur sense of humanity can undergo a rapid evolution and this can be disorienting and alienating, creating a feeling of loss. What weâ€™re talking about is a multiplication of humanity across different spaces, and that will feel very strange. But it doesnâ€™t represent a permanent lossâ€”itâ€™s a doubling of humanity.â€

I sympathize with this sense of loss. I do feel disoriented when looking around my living room and noting that my wife, son and daughter are all tethered to screens. Iâ€™m keenly aware of the almost chemical need to check my phone while listening to a family member speak, oftentimes missing what theyâ€™re saying while my eyes dart towards my phone. In these scenarios, I donâ€™t know what a doubling of humanity will look like. Perhaps real-time notifications will only invade my consciousness with messages Iâ€™ve deemed important. But my current behaviors mirror addiction more than enlightenment.

â€œPeople are becoming anti-social. Before phones you were always thinking about what conversations you could make with someone else. Now many people prefer their phone over conversations with humans,â€ says Mrigaen Kapadia.

Kapadia and his wife co-founded a company, Mobifolio(Opens in a new window), and developed, BreakFree(Opens in a new window), an app aimed at controlling phone addiction. It monitors your mobile usage and tracks how addicted you are to your phone, registering how often you swipe to unlock your screen or which apps you use on a too-frequent basis.

When I asked Mrigaen if prolonged engagement with technology could be deemed personal preference as opposed to addiction, he cited a video showing two Japanese men in their thirties who chose to interact with virtual girlfriends instead of dealing with human ones. He cited it as a dangerous precedent. â€œWe want to make people realize that human company is better than phone company,â€ he said.

But is this a universal truth? I recently wrote a book(Opens in a new window) on the nature of technology and happiness and found a great deal of research showing that our intrinsic wellbeing does increase when weâ€™re with our families, friends, or community. But whoâ€™s to say that community needs to be carbon versus silicon? Perhaps weâ€™ll only prefer human company to machines until technology advances to the point where we canâ€™t tell the difference. And odds are weâ€™ll start to prefer cyborgian humans to the â€œreal thingâ€ because theyâ€™ll be programmable and will never get sick. Weâ€™ll get all the benefits of human interaction without a lot of our current struggles.

[seealso story=""2014/01/15/her-singularity""]

This idea still makes me feel wonky, but it may be my age. Colin, the NYU student, had a different take on the Japanese men's cyber-girlfriends: â€œIt doesnâ€™t matter that she lives in a computerâ€”the woman makes him happy. Whether sheâ€™s biology or technology doesnâ€™t matter anymore,â€ he said.

The heart of being human

â€œWisdom is seeing through false identities,â€ notes Vincent Horn, co-founder of Buddhist Geeks(Opens in a new window), the wildly popular podcast and now annual conference(Opens in a new window). â€œWisdom is seeing through the ways in which we cling to conceptions of who we are and what the world is that are out of synch with how things are functioning.â€

This insight from my interview with Vincent was particularly compelling. Like Patrick Tuckerâ€™s noting how change can bring a sense of alienation, perhaps my current sense of anxiety comes from clinging to a form of humanity that is now out of date. Today, the world functions almost more digitally than not, at least in the visible spectrum. But our consciousness is tied to our screens and data on an ever-expanding basis. Itâ€™s in this in-between space that I donâ€™t know how to function. Horn points out that, â€œWe canâ€™t hold on to any particular thing â€“ it changes the next instant. Itâ€™s when we do hold onto it, that it causes suffering and pain.â€",4/11/2014 0:00,0.481333,9,1,1,4.698577,9,00000,0,3602.688,1863.51,0,0.447803,0.239786,0.05304,0.005175,0.75,0.4,895

7006892,Security Startup DSTRUX Gives All Your Files the Snapchat Treatment,"If you've ever hit ""send"" and regretted it, then DSTRUX is for you.

DSTRUX(Opens in a new window), a seven-person New York startup, on Friday released a cloud-based technology by the same name that lets you send photos and documents that you can destroy remotely. For instance, if you sent a Word document to a friend via Gmail, you could give your friend 10 minutes to look at it before it dissolved. You could also prevent your friend from forwarding the document.

In addition, DSTRUX makes it impossible for the recipient to take a screen capture of the image or document (support for video is a few months off) you sent. Nathan Hecht, CEO and founder of DSTRUX, says his company is working on using the PC's built-in camera to recognize objects like a phone on a camera that could take a picture of the screen as well. Hecht says that technology will be available this fall.

Available for desktop (the mobile version is coming in a few months), DSTRUX has obvious utility for legal agreements, staff memos and, yes, naughty pictures exchanged between consenting adults. It's also free and can be activated with your Facebook or Google account. You don't need to sign up to DSTRUX. The product is also free for the first three months. Pricing has not been announced beyond that point.

Hecht recently demonstrated DSTRUX to Mashable. This is the screen you see when you want to send a file:

Credit:

After you drag the file, you can decide how long the recipient will be able to view it. You can also decide whether it's forward-able or not. Both functions are fluid: If you initially set the viewing time for 30 minutes, you can extend it to three weeks. If the recipient starts forwarding the message, you can remotely disable her ability to do so and make the file dissolve in real time.

On the receiver's end, the file initially appears blurry until you press the space bar. Then you can view it, but if you try touching other keys, it becomes blurry again, making a screen grab impossible.

Hecht says once a document or file is destroyed, it is wiped from the server and no longer exists.

Founded last July, DSTRUX has received $1 million in funding so far from a private source. The company's introduction comes after Facebook reportedly offered $3 billion to buy Snapchat, whose messages self-destruct after 10 seconds. In January, Confide launched an app that lets professionals send encrypted messages that automatically disappear so users can have ""off-the-record"" conversation.

TigerText(Opens in a new window) also launched a self-destructing text message service in 2010 for general consumers and shifted the following year to focusing more on enterprise use. Gryphn(Opens in a new window), which bills itself as a secure texting tool with the self-destruct feature for business use, launched in early 2013.

Hecht says he realizes that there are potential competitors in the space. He's hoping that Google and Facebook aren't among them. ""If Google and Facebook see this and we get some traction and say 'Wait, let's do this,' they're going to say 'Wait, they're already doing this on our own platform. So we're going to compete with a guy who's already on our own platform?' So in my twisted mind I was like 'Google and Facebook would say maybe we should scoop these guys up or back them rather than compete with them because then they'd just be competing with someone who's enhancing our platform.""",4/11/2014 0:00,0.507277,20,1,0,4.84739,10,00000,0,3602.688,1761.835,2300,0.375715,0.10967,0.028112,0.014056,0.5,0.136364,656

7026736,5 Things to Know About the Most Powerful Woman in Health Care*,"*Pending her confirmation.

Kathleen Sebelius is resigning from her post as secretary of the U.S. Health and Human Services, thus relinquishing her responsibility for the buggy Healthcare.gov. President Barack Obama has nominated Sylvia Mathews Burwell to take her place.

Introducing his new candidate, the Obama called Burwell ""a proven manager"" who ""knows how to deliver results.""

Sure, she'll be tasked with oversight of the $1.668 trillion health care industry, but what everyone really wants to know is... When will she fix the damn website? Here's what you need to know about the woman who has the most-talked-about job in D.C. today.

1. She's #TeamClinton

Burwell worked on Bill Clinton's 1992 election campaign, chaired his economic transition team, and then served as staff director of the White House's National Economic Council during the first year of Clinton's presidency. She's also held positions as chief of staff at the Treasury Department, deputy chief of staff at Clinton's White House and deputy director at Clinton's Office of Management and Budget (OMB).

2. She's friends with Bill Gates

And by ""friends with Bill Gates"" we mean she held leadership positions at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation for a 10-year period, starting in 2001. From 2001 to 2002, Burwell served as executive vice president. She moved up to chief operating officer in 2002 and served there until 2006, when she took over as president of the Global Development Program. Wonkblog's Dylan Matthews notes(Opens in a new window) that she nearly became the foundation's CEO in 2008 but was instead passed over in favor of Microsoft executive Jeff Raikes.

3. She's pretty well-liked

Back in June 2013, Burwell was confirmed as head of OMB by a 96-0 margin, and her tenure was free of any major controversies -- a rarity in polarized D.C. Granted, she's going in to manage the Republican party's chief gripe -- Obamacare -- so the honeymoon might not last long. ""She has the benefit of keen intelligence and knows enough to do the job without the long history of speaking out on controversial topics that could create a problem,"" Peter Orszag, a former OMB director, told NBC News(Opens in a new window). ""She is basically right in the sweet spot."" Senator John McCain couldn't agree more.

Sylvia Burwell is an excellent choice to be the next #HHS(Opens in a new window) Secretaryâ€” John McCain (@SenJohnMcCain) April 11, 2014(Opens in a new window)

4. She's knows her stuff

Officials familiar with the way Sylvia Mathews Burwell operates seem to unanimously agree on one thing: She knows the source material, and she's really good at getting things done. The president calls(Opens in a new window) Burwell ""a rock"" and ""a steady hand"" during the negotiations that followed last October's government shutdown.

""I could choose no manager as experienced, as competent as my current director of the Office of Management and Budget: Sylvia Mathews Burwell,"" Obama said on Friday at a ceremony introducing his pick. ""She is a specialist at getting things done,"" former Treasury Director Larry Summers tells CNBC(Opens in a new window). ""I've never met a policy official with more focus on and capacity for execution.""

5. She's got her work cut out for her

Americans remain deeply divided over Obamacare. Congress even more so. â€œThe challenge for Ms. Burwell, or any other successor, is to help Congress find the right way to repair the damage Obamacare has done to American families,â€ Sen. Lamar Alexander, the top Republican on the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, said. He highlighted(Opens in a new window) one major sticking point Burwell will have to navigate on day one: how to frame the challenge that lies ahead.

""Now, we know thereâ€™s still more work to do at HHS,"" President Obama said on Friday. ""Thereâ€™s more work to do to implement the Affordable Care Act. Thereâ€™s another enrollment period coming up about six months from now. Thereâ€™s a whole array of responsibilities to meet over at this large and very important agency.""

7006836,February Was the Cruelest Month for Air Travel,"If you had a flight canceled in February, you were not alone.

U.S. airlines canceled 23,719 flights (5.5%) that month. That was enough to make it the worst February for domestic air travel since the Department of Transportation started tracking cancelations in 1995.

Delays were also on the rise. Only 70.7% of U.S. flights in February arrived on time, according to the Department of Transportation.

Even so, airlines snatched one small victory from the jaws of defeat: no planes were stuck on the tarmac for more than three hours. Despite thousands of delays and cancellations, carriers managed to keep to the new federal guidelines for tarmac delays.

The best airlines for on-time arrivals were Hawaiian and Alaska; the two carriers have routes that generally avoid the areas of the country with the worst weather.

Hawaiian Airlines - 90.1%

Alaska Airlines - 85.7%

Delta Air Lines - 77.5%

Virgin America - 73.2%

Skywest Airlines - 71.1%

United Airlines - 70.0%

American Eagle - 66.5%

JetBlue Airways - 64.6%

Frontier Airlines - 64.2%

ExpressJet Airlines - 59.0%

A flight is considered on time if it arrives within 15 minutes of the scheduled time, according to the Department of Transportation.

The report includes all airlines in the U.S. with at least 1% of the total domestic scheduled-service passenger revenues. Several small regional carrier are not included.

WikiLeaks presumably wants to draw attention to their entrance in the U.S., in case there are any delays at customs.

In the past few months Greenwald has repeatedly said he wouldn't feel safe coming to the United States in the current political climate. In January, Director of National Intelligence Jams Clapper implied that the journalists working with Snowden are ""accomplices"" during a congressional hearing, and Rep.

Moreover, Poitras has often been stopped(Opens in a new window) at the U.S. border and detained for hours for no apparent reason, which gives supporters of the two journalists some reason for concern.

But Greenwald told The Huffington Post(Opens in a new window) on Thursday that he's not afraid.

More than a year ago, Auernheimer was found guilty and sentenced to 3 and half years in prison for accessing an AT&T public server in 2010, and obtaining 114,000 email addresses of iPad owners.

Auernheimer then shared the database with Gawker(Opens in a new window), and the feds charged him with identity theft and hacking crimes.

SEE ALSO: Inside the Syrian Electronic Army Hack on CNN

The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia threw out his sentence, arguing that prosecutors were wrong to charge him in New Jersey. Auernheimer accessed the AT&T server while living in Arkansas, his alleged accomplice was living in San Francisco, and the servers they accessed were located in Dallas and Atlanta. But prosecutors charged him in New Jersey -- and it has never been clear why.

The court ruled that this was an improper venue, and vacated the sentence. Technically, the feds could still charge him for the crimes in another state, but at this point it's unclear if they will.

In the meantime, Auernheimer's lawyer Tor Ekeland successfully filed a motion to have him released immediately, and will drive from New York City to Pennsylvania to pick him up on Friday night.

I am going to pick weev up tonight. #freeweev(Opens in a new window)â€” Tor Ekeland, P.C. (@TorEkelandPC) April 11, 2014(Opens in a new window)

The court vacated Auernheimer sentence based on the venue, but his lawyers had also appealed his conviction on the merits of the case, arguing that Auernheimer didn't break the much-maligned Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (the same law used against Internet freedom activist and coder Aaron Swartz).

His lawyers argued that the information Auernheimer accessed was publicly available and thus there was no unauthorized access to AT&T's servers. But the three judges of the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, during the appeals hearing, focused instead(Opens in a new window) on the venue issue.

While in prison, Auernheimer maintained an online presence. He sent incendiary tweets and posted messages to his SoundCloud account.

Speaking to reporters during a state visit to Shanghai, the Australian leader said he was ""confident"" the sounds his search teams had picked up were coming from the plane's black boxes -- and he also reminded us time was running out.

""It's been very much narrowed down because we've now had a series of detections, some for quite a long period of time,"" Abbott said(Opens in a new window), kicking off a round of speculation that authorities had found the plane.

""Nevertheless, we're getting to the stage where the signal from what we are very confident is the black box is starting to fade,"" Abbott added. ""We are hoping to get as much information as we can before the signal finally expires.""

However, the PM made his remarks at the same time as Australia's Chief Coordinator of the Joint Agency Coordination Centre, Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston, emailed reporters to say there had been no major breakthrough in the search for MH370.

â€œThe Australian Joint Acoustic Analysis Centre has analysed the acoustic data and confirmed that the signal reported in the vicinity of the Australian Defence Vessel Ocean Shield is unlikely to be related to the aircraft black boxes,â€ Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston (Retâ€™d) said.

â€œOn the information I have available to me, there has been no major breakthrough in the search for MH370,â€ Houston added.

Air Chief Houston said Ocean Shield would continue its ""focused sweeps"" with the towed pinger locator and that it was vital to glean ""as much information as possible while the batteries on the underwater locator beacons may still be active.""

Search teams have yet to deploy an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle, awaiting advice from experts on board the ship. That decision is days away, he said.

The conflicting remarks show the high hopes Australian PM Tony Abbott has that search teams will find the black box before its batteries die -- if they haven't already expired.

Black boxes are built to last for 30 days, and as of Friday April 11 it's been 33 days since Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 vanished after taking off from Kuala Lumpur International Airport.

Search teams in the southern Indian Ocean said on Thursday they had detected yet another signal that authorities hope is coming from the black boxes on Malaysia Airlines Flight 370. That made five distinct signals in just a few days, which helped narrow the search area even more for teams who have been combing the seas for more than a month.

Youâ€™ll have a few extra hours in the day to get to those bigger things youâ€™ve been wanting to. Youâ€™ll have the opportunity to serve as a mentor(Opens in a new window) and coach and develop your own leadership and managerial skills.

And a not-so-great intern? Well, ask anyone whoâ€™s had one -- that situation can be more trouble than itâ€™s worth.

But, sniffing out the latter category from the former can be tough when most interns donâ€™t come to the table with much work experience or professional skills. What do you ask in an interview if you donâ€™t have past positions to use as a gauge?

Just remember: The goals of interviewing a prospective intern are the same as interviewing a job candidate(Opens in a new window) -- you want to learn about the personâ€™s skills and abilities, assess their interest in your company, and determine whether or not theyâ€™ll be a good fit with your team. Here are a few questions in each of those categories to get you started.

You Want to Know: Do They Have the Skills and Abilities?

Tell me about your coursework. In what ways is it relevant to this position?

Even the most mundane college class has some professional benefit to it. There are the obvious ways -- if youâ€™re looking for a PR intern, then having someone who is majoring in marketing or public relations and has worked on projects that relate to your industry is a clear connection. But other classes have indirect benefits(Opens in a new window) as well -- for example, writing papers takes research, organization, time management, and editing skills, and foreign language classes require communicating effectively in a diverse environment. By having candidates identify and articulate those connections, youâ€™ll get a good sense of where their strengths lie.

Tell me about your volunteer or community service experience?

Experiences like volunteering in the community, planning on-campus events, or participating in clubs or Greek life can be incredibly valuable in developing professional skills. I once hired an intern who had no paid work experience but a resume chock-full of impressive volunteer work. She planned an annual 5K for cancer research on her campus for three years (hello, leadership and event planning skills), worked at the local elementary school reading to children (clearly, she was responsible), and was the treasurer of her sorority (i.e., had top-notch budget management and organization skills). Asking candidates to describe what theyâ€™ve learned and gained from these experiences can be a great way to determine what theyâ€™ll bring to a professional setting.

What skills do you want to gain from this experience, and what skills can you offer us?

Sometimes just asking the question directly is best. Candidates may have great skills that arenâ€™t reflected in their coursework or on-campus activity -- or, they may know that they need experience in a certain area, and that your internship will provide them with just that. Either way, look for people who have really thought through what theyâ€™ll bring to and take from the opportunity.

You Want to Know: Are They Interested in Your Company?

Why do you want to intern here?

Sometimes students just need an internship, and theyâ€™ll take it where they can get it. But the best candidates -- the ones who will likely work hard and be excited to learn more about your industry and function -- will be applying because they respect your companyâ€™s mission or have some connection to the work that is done. Look for people who are really compelled to join your team.

What do you know about our company? What Questions do you still have?

As with any good job interview, you want an intern candidate who has done his or her research(Opens in a new window). Ask a few questions that will reveal knowledge of your company (or not). For example, is there a program that sheâ€™s most interested in, or does he have a thought on your most recent press release? In addition, letting candidates ask questions about the company and role can reveal their ability to think critically about what theyâ€™ve learned.

You Want to Know: Will They Fit In?

What are your expectations?

Asking candidates what their expectations of the internship are is a great way to ascertain whether or not they understand your company and the work theyâ€™ll be doing. Making sure both you and the candidate are clear about the work involved, the required hours, and the pay (if any) is the first step to ensuring a successful setup for both of you.

What do you know about the industry?

An intern will become a member of your team and will likely interact with other colleagues, vendors, and clients at some point. So, you want to be sure that anyone you bring on is familiar with basic industry jargon, programs, and procedures -- or at the very least, will be excited to learn about them. A candidate who has done informational interviews, regularly reads industry blogs, or has a vested interest in the field will always be better than one whoâ€™s just trying to get experience anywhere.

What are your goals after graduation?

Learning about candidatesâ€™ long-term goals can give you insight into the kind of people they are (and want to become). They donâ€™t necessarily have to perfectly align with the role and industry, but the internship will be a better experience for both of you if itâ€™s at least somewhat related. Especially if youâ€™re hoping your intern will eventually turn into a full-time hire, a candidate who, say, aspires to work for a large investment banking firm after graduation might not be a great fit in your mission-driven nonprofit.",4/11/2014 0:00,0.466435,11,13,0,4.720045,6,Entertainment,2024.5,4336.89,3509.254,1700,0.347202,0.082657,0.024636,0.020157,0.4,0,1400
7026742,Lab-Grown Vaginas Successfully Implanted in Patients,"Researchers have grown vaginas in a lab, and the organs are working normally in four teenage patients who were among the first people to receive such an implant, scientists reported April 10, 2014.

All of the patients in the study underwent surgery five to eight years ago because they were born with a rare genetic condition in which the vagina and uterus are underdeveloped or absent.

Scientists grew each vagina from the patient's own cells, and then implanted it in her body. So far in the follow-up, the treatment has been successful, and the patients who are now sexually active have reported normal function, according to the study(Opens in a new window), published April 10 in the journal Lancet.

Although this is a small pilot study, the results show that vaginal organs can be constructed in the lab and used successfully in people, said study researcher Dr. Anthony Atala, director of Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center's Institute for Regenerative Medicine.

Although more research needs to be done, growing vaginal tissue from a person's own cells could potentially be a new treatment option for patients with vaginal cancer(Opens in a new window) or injuries who require reconstructive surgeries, the researchers said.

""A lot of what we are doing right now is really applicable to patients who have deformity or abnormal organs for many other conditions -- of course, the most prominent being cancer -- [and] also patients who may have an injury in the area,"" Atala said.

The girls in the study had a congenital deformation called Mayer-Rokitansky-KÃ¼ster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome, which affects between one in 1,500 and one in 4,000 female infants, the researchers said.

To build the personalized vaginas, the researchers took a small piece of vulvar tissue, less than half the size of a postage stamp, from each patient, and then allowed the cells to multiply in lab dishes.

The vagina is made up of two major layers with two cell types: muscle cells and vaginal epithelial cells. To build these layers, the researchers placed one cell type on one face of a scaffold(Opens in a new window), made of a fabric-like material, and placed the other cell type on the other face of the scaffold.

""We were able to shape the scaffold specifically for each patient, and place this device with the cells in a bioreactor -- which is an ovenlike device and has the same conditions as the human body -- for about a week, until it was slightly more mature,"" Atala said.

Once the organs were ready, doctors surgically created a cavity in the patients' bodies, and stitched one side of the vaginal organ to the opening of the cavity and the other side to the uterus.

""The whole process takes about five to six weeks, from the time we take the tissue from the patient to the time we actually plant the engineered construct back into the patient,"" Atala said.

The girls were between 13 and 18 years old at the time of their surgeries. Researchers followed up with the patients every year for five to eight years, and examined the organs using X-rays and biopsies to check their structure. Patients also reported on the organs' functionality, including the sexual function.

Data from these yearly follow-up visits show that up to eight years after the surgeries, the organs had normal function, including normal sexual functions, such as desire and pain-free intercourse, according to the study.

Current treatments for MRKH syndrome include dilation of existing tissue or, for more severe cases, reconstructive surgery using a piece of intestine or a piece of skin to create a new vaginal organ.",4/11/2014 0:00,0,0,10,0,0,8,00000,1643.775,4597.766,2577.554,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1400

7006754,LinkedIn Says Mystery App Is Coming Soon,"LinkedIn has big plans for mobile adoption in 2014, and a new standalone app (or two) appears to be among them.

The professional networking company has ""more apps planned"" for 2014, according to Parker Barrile, VP of Product for LinkedIn Talent Solutions -- with one of them coming in the ""not too distant future.""

[seealso slug=""free-iphone-apps-every-day/""]

That app, the company's fifth, could arrive in the next few weeks. Here are LinkedIn's existing four apps:

LinkedIn -- This is the standard LinkedIn mobile app for phones and iPad, and brings most of the features from LinkedIn's web version to users' mobile devices.

Pulse -- LinkedIn acquired Pulse and its mobile newsreader app for $90 million back in April of 2013. The app surfaces popular news and feature articles from the web, and replaced LinkedIn Today as the company's news curation technology for the main site back in November.

LinkedIn Recruiter -- The Recruiter app was released in October and is primarily for human resources and recruiting professionals. It brings tools used to monitor and discover new employees on LinkedIn to a standalone mobile app. The company announced an Android version of the app Thursday.

LinkedIn Contacts -- Contacts extracts LinkedIn info such as calendars, profile alerts, and profile details from your connections into a standalone app.

Neither Barrile nor Joff Redfern, VP of mobile products at LinkedIn, would share specific details about upcoming app, but we can assume the new app is intended for LinkedIn's general user base -- unlike Recruiter, which was built specifically for human resources and recruiting professionals.

Reaching a larger audience with the new app should help LinkedIn build upon the company's base of 277 million members worldwide.

LinkedIn doesn't have a standalone messaging app right now, and other social networks like Facebook and Twitter have made private messaging a priority in recent weeks.

Don't expect LinkedIn to roll out a messenger app now, however, as the company doesn't currently offer a chat-style service. It's more likely the app will pull from one of LinkedIn's existing features.

â€œMobile apps work best when they are very focused on one specific use case or value proposition,"" says Barrile. ""So whenever we see a use case among our members that we believe is meaningful enough or broadly based enough to merit its own app, weâ€™ll build that app.â€

LinkedIn's existing flagship app (L) and news reader app Pulse are among the company's four existing mobile apps. Credit: Kurt Wagner/Mashable

Mobile continues to be a focus for LinkedIn. The company isn't shy about adopting the same ""multi-app"" strategy used by Facebook, which has already added multiple new apps this year via internal development and acquisition.

At a LinkedIn event in San Francisco on Thursday, Barrile shared that 41% of all global traffic comes to LinkedIn via mobile, and CEO Jeff Weiner said in November that the company will achieve 50% traffic from mobile within the year.

This milestone -- 50% of traffic from mobile -- is what LinkedIn is calling its ""mobile moment,"" and the company has been preparing for months to accommodate users who will be seeking mobile products, says Redfern. This preparation also requires the company to prepare mobile revenue streams, he added.

New apps are just just part of this preparation strategy. LinkedIn on Friday announced(Opens in a new window) its first partnership with Samsung to integrate a user's LinkedIn network into tools like calendars and contacts on their phone. It's a way to help users connect more regularly with others on the platform, says Redfern, and should help with engagement.

All of the preparation is built on the expectation that the majority of LInkedIn users will soon access the site from their mobile devices. When that ""mobile moment"" does come, Redfern says the company will be ready.

""This is a company that is absolutely squared at the mobile moment,"" he says. ""We are very much on the path of mobilizing our company.""",4/11/2014 0:00,0.524554,8,8,0,4.51828,8,Entertainment,0,7261.8,2374.635,2350,0.445864,0.234267,0.047312,0.010753,0.65,0,15800

Now NATO's Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE) have published a series of before and after satellite photographs that show a clear military buildup in a number of sites that line Russiaâ€™s border with Ukraine, dating from March 22 to April 2, 2014.

Rain, smudges and 3D movies can be real pains, but you might soon be able to check one annoyance off the list: your glasses sliding down your nose.

Don Hejny created Nerdwax(Opens in a new window) -- a beeswax and coconut oil-based blend of all-natural and organic ingredients in a lip balm-sized tube that you apply to the pads or bridge of your glasses to prevent slippage.

Hejny, an audio engineer from Nashville, Tenn., was inspired to create the wax four years ago when he was at a concert in Texas and saw a musician he was working with constantly have to push her glasses back up her nose. Out of sympathy, he wanted to walk on stage and hold her glasses in place so she could focus on playing her music.

""I remember after that show calling my wife and being like 'I just had the most amazing idea,'"" Hejny told Mashable.

Similarly, when he would tour with musicians for summer music festivals, Hejny's glasses would always fall off when he had to move amps and other stage equipment due to the heat. The desire to find a simple solution to a simple problem compelled Hejny to create Nerdwax.

""I was frustrated and found a great solution,"" said Hejny. ""I know that there are so many people just like me out there who feel the same frustration but have no solution.""

But creating the right formula and combination of ingredients took a lot of trial and error to get it just right -- so many tries that Hejny can't remember the exact number. Because the wax would be touching a user's face, Hejny, with sensitive skin himself, insisted on its all-natural composition. That meant hours crafting the correct formula.

Hejny creates the wax by hand and sources all the ingredients from the U.S. He's currently running a Kickstarter campaign(Opens in a new window), where he has raised more than $16,000 of an initial $5,000 goal with 27 days left.

""Kickstarter is amazing because it is really going to help us discover market value,"" Hejny said. ""We reached out to a ton of people in our network and asked what they would expect to pay for a tube and the answer was always somewhere between $7 to $12.""

At the moment, donating $10 to the campaign will net a backer one tube of Nerdwax.

7026621,Report: NSA Knew About Heartbleed Bug for 2 Years and Said Nothing,"The NSA knew about the Internet security bug Heartbleed and regularly used it to gather intelligence for at least two years, anonymous sources told Bloomberg(Opens in a new window).

If the report is true -- both the White House and the NSA say it's not (see below) -- the NSA could have collected information like passwords and private communications from hundreds of thousands of websites, since Heartbleed is a bug in the popular open-source encryption software OpenSSL, used to secure data flowing from users' computers to hundreds of thousands of websites, including Gmail and Facebook. Almost two-thirds of all sites on the Internet use OpenSSL, according to estimates, making this bug possibly one of the most dangerous the Internet has ever seen and potentially allowing the NSA to access information on millions of users.

Roughly two hours after Bloomberg's report was published, the NSA and the White House denied the allegations in statements sent to Mashable.

""NSA was not aware of the recently identified vulnerability in OpenSSL, the so-called Heartbleed vulnerability, until it was made public in a private-sector cybersecurity report,"" an NSA spokesperson wrote in a statement to Mashable. ""Reports that say otherwise are wrong.""

The White House National Security Council Spokesperson Caitlin Hayden also said that neither the NSA nor any other federal agency knew about the Heartbleed bug.

""If the Federal government, including the intelligence community, had discovered this vulnerability prior to last week, it would have been disclosed to the community responsible for OpenSSL,"" Hayden said in the statement.

By not alerting anyone to the bug, the NSA could have left the door open for other intelligence agencies across the world to exploit Heartbleed, provided they found the bug. This revelation also seems to contradict one of the NSA's core missions, which is protecting and defending American cybersecurity.

""Given the scale of Heartbleed, deciding to exploit this vulnerability rather than fix it, makes a mockery of any claims that the NSA defends the networks of the U.S.A.,"" an employee on the security team of a major Internet company, who asked not to be named, told Mashable.

Mashable asked an NSA spokesperson on Wednesday whether it had known about Heartbleed or whether it could comment on the bug. ""We'll defer to DHS [Department of Homeland Security],"" the spokesperson responded.

We also reached out to the Department of Homeland Security but haven't heard back yet. We will continue to update this story as we get more information.

The revelation shocked the security and civil liberties world.

""Utterly, indefensibly shameful,"" tweeted(Opens in a new window) Kevin Bankston, the New America Foundation Policy Director. ""Way to be evil, guys.""

Matthew Prince, the CEO of security firm Cloudflare, tweeted(Opens in a new window) that it's ""hard as a tech company today to not feel like we're at war with our own government.""

Despite the outrage, this revelation doesn't come as a complete surprise for many. Over the past few days, some have already speculated whether the NSA used Heartbleed to breach SSL, since documents leaked by Edward Snowden revealed the spy agency has been trying to breach it for years.

""It would not at all surprise me if the NSA had discovered this long before the rest of us had,"" Matt Blaze, a cryptographer and computer security professor at the University of Pennsylvania, told Wired(Opens in a new window). ""Itâ€™s certainly something that the NSA would find extremely useful in their arsenal.""

UPDATE, 4:48 p.m.: This story has been updated to include the NSA's statement refuting Bloomberg's report.

7006620,Subway Rider Spots Crafty Credit Card Skimmer,"An eagle-eyed New York City subway rider has spotted and removed what turned out to be a rather sophisticated credit card skimming system from the front of a MetroCard vending machine.

Skimmer after being removed from MVM Credit: MTA

According to New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) City Transit, an unidentified rider discovered the device at New York's 59th Street Columbus Circle subway station late Thursday. It consisted of a credit card skimmer placed over the vending machine's official card reader and -- here's the ingenious part -- a credit card camera situated just above the vending machine.

That camera was actually hidden inside a tiny, two-outlet power adapter. There was a tiny hole in its base for the camera.

Apparently, the camera was activated whenever an unsuspecting MTA customer inserted or removed their card. That meant the thieves would have both the scanned card info and any details about the card (and person) they can glean from the over-the-head photo. The camera was powered by a large battery pack hidden on top of the vending machine.

The customer who spotted the skimmer removed it immediately and delivered it to the station agent.

It's unclear how long the device, which was on the southbound side of the station, was in use, or if the thieves were regularly checking it for new card data. At time of writing, the MTA was checking all MetroCard vending machines (there are 468 stations in New York City) for additional devices.

In the meantime, the MTA reminded MetroCard customers to be vigilant when they use machines and look for anything amiss. Those who bought tickets via credit card at the Columbus Circle station will also want to check their card statements for unusual activity.

You can see the whole mind-blowing setup, in photos that the MTA released on Friday, below. Whomever that anonymous rider is, he or she has the thanks of a grateful city.

""I feel compelled to personally take on all the evil which some priests -- quite a few in number, obviously not compared to the number of all the priests -- to personally ask for forgiveness for the damage they have done for having sexually abused children,"" Francis said, according to the Vatican Radio's website(Opens in a new window).

Francis said the acts of sexual abuse by priests were ""evil,"" according to the website(Opens in a new window), and that these priests had committed ""moral damage.""

The statement comes about two months after a United Nations report in February concluded the Church was protecting itself rather than protecting victims of sexual abuse. The statement asked that child abusers resign or be fired, adding that Church documents should be made available to law enforcement officials so that anyone who committed abuse or covered it up would be held accountable, according to the New York Times(Opens in a new window).

During an interview in March, Francis defended the church's stance toward priests who have committed sexual abuse.

""No one else has done more [to tackle child sexual abuse],"" Francis said, according to the BBC(Opens in a new window). ""Yet the Church is the only one to have been attacked.""

Accusations of sexual abuse in the Catholic Church have abounded for years, and the Church has also been accused of either trying to cover up the abuse or not doing enough to prevent it in the future.

Francis set up a Church committee to help victims of sexual abuse committed by priests in 2013, and early in 2014, he ensured that the sexual abuse of a child was considered a crime by the Vatican. The Pope has also directed Church officials to look into cases(Opens in a new window) in which priests are accused of sexual abuse.",4/11/2014 0:00,0.582822,17,4,0,4.695522,10,Business,1684.088,3629.085,2710.723,0,0.426677,0.104968,0.041791,0.023881,0,0,1900
6901455,Pixel Insanity Continues: Here's the First Quad HD OLED Phone Screen,"Though their importance is questionable, pixel counts in cellphones are on the rise. The first Quad HD phones -- that would be devices with 2,560 x 1,440 resolution -- launched back in October. Now a display maker is giving phone manufacturers a brand new way to build them.

AU Optronics(Opens in a new window), one of the biggest display makers in the world, has just unveiled an 5.7-inch AMOLED (active-matrix organic light-emitting diode) panel with Quad HD resolution. At that size, the pixel density is 513 pixels per inch (ppi).

The company says it's the world's highest resolution AMOLED display, although probably not for long; the blog OLED Info(Opens in a new window) says others from Sharp, SEL and Samsung Display are coming very soon.

[seealso slug=""cool-city-maps""]

AMOLED screens, found in phones such as the Samsung Galaxy S5 and Moto X, have some advantages over LCD panels, such as the ability to govern the lighting of every individual pixel. In a regular LCD screen, the display requires a backlight that consumes power even if only a single pixel is highlighted.

AMOLED screens are extremely thin, and the AUO's high-res panel is just over half a millimeter thick, or 0.022 of an inch. That's complete with touch sensitivity, and the company says a special driver for the display makes it even more sensitive to your fingers than a regular sceen.

You may well ask why you would ever want a phone with such absurdly high resolution, especially since a smartphone display becomes ""Retina"" -- meaning the human eye can no longer discern individual pixels at normal viewing distances -- at about 300ppi -- or 214 ppi lower than this screen.

Factor in the extra power required to illuminate more pixels, the greater burden on the processor and the fact that few apps support such high resolutions, and you might even call this neverending pursuit of pixels a fool's game.

Still, as we march toward a world of 4K TV displays and 4K content to go on them, there will be a need for even mobile devices to deal with extreme pixel counts. That doesn't necessarily mean they need to display them, but phones and tablets do have to start getting used to handling ever-higher resolutions.

Finally, there are always the bragging rights to consider. When it comes to pixels, people simply want moar!",4/11/2014 0:00,0.676471,3,0,1,4.331395,6,Business,0,14424.67,3878.035,57200,0.558333,-0.07235,0.011628,0.02907,0,0,1400

The ruling, in a case which goes back to the death of a trainer at SeaWorld's Orlando theme park in 2010, could mean the company will have to increase the separation between trainers and whales during its highly successful live shows Reuters(Opens in a new window) reports.

[seealso url = ""http://mashable.com/2014/03/09/sports-biz-how-to-make-it""]

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit's ruling upholds a previous finding by the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). OSHA fined SeaWorld $75,000 in August 2010(Opens in a new window) following the death of trainer Dawn Brancheau in February of that same year.

A 12,000-pound bull orca dragged Brancheau underwater and killed her as shocked park visitors watched. SeaWorld's fine was later reduced to $12,000.

More important than the fine from SeaWorld's perspective, however, was whether OSHA exceeded its authority in regulating an atypical workplace by general federal safety laws. The appeals court ruled that the agency acted correctly.

Judge Judith Rogers wrote that stricter safety regulations -- such as physical barriers between whales and trainers, or more room separating the two -- ""does not change the essential nature of the business,"" and the company can still successfully put on its shows, Reuters reports.

In a dissenting opinion, Judge Brett Kavanaugh wrote that people who work in unusual, and often dangerous, positions in the sports and entertainment fields understand the risks to which they expose themselves.

7006508,You're Not Going to Deform Your Spine by Texting Too Much,"Constant texting can be dangerous -- whether it's behind the wheel or crossing the street. But it turns out that perennial claims that texting is having an adverse, and potentially lethal, impact on people's posture may be overstated.

For years, stories have appeared(Opens in a new window) online(Opens in a new window) warning about the bodily harm associated with compulsively bending one's neck downward to look at their phone. Many of these articles cite warnings from the United Chiropractic Association(Opens in a new window), which says that frequent texting can result in hyperkyphosis - a severe curvature of the spine that leads to increased mortality rates.

But recently, Harriet Hall of the blog Science-Based Medicine(Opens in a new window) refuted the claims of the UCA. Though hyperkyphosis can do very real harm -- particularly in the elderly -- Hall argues that the link between this pronounced form of spinal disfiguration and texting has not been conclusively proven.

First, a quick crash course in chiropractic medicine. Kyphosis is a condition involving an ""exaggeration(Opens in a new window) of the natural curvature of the spine."" This malady becomes hyperkyphosis when this bend exceeds 45 degrees.

A recent Telegraph(Opens in a new window) article positing the spinal dangers of texting notes that hyperkyphosis has been shown to increase mortality rates by 1.44 times. That's roughly the same increase in the likelihood of death caused by obesity.

""Chiropractors have said a lot of silly things, but this ranks right up there among the silliest,"" Hall writes. ""They are just making stuff up and using scaremongering as a practice-building technique.""

Hall, a former family physician and Air Force flight surgeon who has written prolifically(Opens in a new window) to debunk bad medical advice, says the idea that cellphone use could lead to irreparable spine damage is akin to the old wives tale that crossing one's eyes can become a permanent condition.

Like most myths, there is a kernel of truth to this one, Hall says. Texting can lead to a mild form of kyphosis, so mild in fact that it's what you or I might call mere slouching. And although slouching can cause some temporary muscle pain, it's certainly not life threatening or irreversible.

The more severe hyperkyphosis condition (which would manifest itself like the Hunchback of Notre Dame), is usually caused by more dramatic factors. It's often found in older people, particularly women, as a result of osteoporosis causing actual deterioration of vertebrae. In younger people, it's usually the result of some kind of physical accident or birth defect.

""Remember when Mom told you not to cross your eyes because they might get stuck and stay that way permanently?"" Hall writes. ""Of course that can't really happen; and no amount of hunching over a cellphone is going to produce a permanent hyperkyphosis either.""",4/11/2014 0:00,0.716049,2,0,1,4.423313,7,Entertainment,1700,5375.357,3603.189,1200,0.455303,0.159091,0.03681,0.006135,0.1875,-0.125,5900

Fortunately for those affected by the storm, it made landfall in considerably weaker shape compared to its peak intensity as a high-end Category 4 storm on the U.S. Saffir-Simpson scale, and a Category 5 storm on the Australian scale, with wind gusts of close to 190 miles per hour.

At landfall, the storm had maximum sustained winds of about 100 miles per hour, with higher gusts. The storm is now moving south-southwest just inland, over higher terrain, making it prone to additional weakening.

It is forecast to produce heavy rains and gusty winds(Opens in a new window), along with storm surge flooding, all the way south to the tourist hot spot of Cairns, with some computer models projecting that the center of the storm may swing further eastward, which could allow the storm to maintain some of its strength over the ocean and bring more significant hazards to Cairns and the tourist resorts north of the city.

â€œThere remains the small possibility that Ita could track south close to the coast tonight and maintain an intensity capable of generating wind gusts to 130 kilometres per hour in Cairns during Saturday,â€ said Australiaâ€™s Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) in an online storm discussion(Opens in a new window).

Cyclone #Ita(Opens in a new window) made landfall at about 1130UTC just west of Cape Flattery, peak gust of 86kts there. pic.twitter.com/PmxNvbjUiI(Opens in a new window)â€” Brian McNoldy (@BMcNoldy) April 11, 2014(Opens in a new window)

Cairns is one of the major gateways to the Great Barrier Reef, drawing tourists from around the world to dive and snorkel to encounter the areaâ€™s unique marine life.

The BOM said the storm underwent subtle changes in its eye wall, which is the strongest part of tropical cyclone, comprised of towering thunderstorms immediately surrounding the calm center of the storm. When Ita crossed the coast, its eye wall had formed two rings, or what meteorologists refer to as a ""double eye wall structure.""

When this happens, the maximum winds in the storm tend to decline, since some energy in the original, unified eye wall is reduced. Weather forecasters have difficulty anticipating such subtle changes in storm structure far ahead of time, including the development double eye wall structures, which are usually part of larger eye wall replacement cycles, during which the original eye wall weakens and is replaced, which results in temporary weakening before a storm strengthens again.

In Cyclone Ita's case, the storm's small size also made it more vulnerable to weakening, the BOM said. â€œThe system should weaken below cyclone intensity overnight Saturday night although strong winds are possible about the coast.â€

Cyclone warnings remain posted for areas from Cape Melville to Cardwell, including Cooktown, Port Douglas and Cairns. While the BOM is warning coastal residents in these areas to prepare for storm surge-related flooding, it is not forecasting a catastrophically high storm surge, which could have resulted if the storm came ashore at its peak intensity.

According to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation(Opens in a new window), or ABC, there were many reports of trees down and homes damaged in Cooktown as well as other areas closer to the storm center. About 30,000 people were evacuated from low-lying parts of Cairns in anticipation of storm surge flooding, ABC reported.

Some 30% of existing Twitter accounts have sent 10 or fewer tweets, and just 13% of registered accounts have tweeted more than 100 times. Twopcharts is unable to discern whether users have logged onto their accounts. Its report is based on users' activity.

The report, which was released Friday, comes after Twitter disclosed in February that it had 244 million active monthly users in the last three months of 2013, meaning about 730 million people have created accounts on the site, but are not active on a monthly basis.

Twopcharts has previously reported that of the 284.4 million new accounts in 2013, only 12.9%(Opens in a new window) were still tweeting in February 2014.

Realizing that some new users find its experience hard to navigate, Twitter has introduced enhancements lately including restyled, Facebook-like user profile pages and pop-up notifications on its website.

For Twitter, increasing engagement helps fight churn, since active users are less likely to abandon the service. Tweeting, favoriting and resharing also help Twitter to target ads for users since by taking such actions, the users indicate their preferences and interests.

The report comes as Twitter's stock price is flirting with its all-time low. At this writing, the stock was hovering around $40 in early trading. The stock has traded for as low as $38.80.

Liviu Berechet Antoni, the creator of Altergaze, envisions a future where virtual reality technology could be used as a way to share and collaborate in the real world -- architects showcasing designs to clients, for example.

""I am a firm believer that virtual reality should be used as a way of connecting people rather than isolating them into their own virtual worlds,"" Antoni told Mashable. ""A lot of people, when talking about virtual reality, expect to see a simulation of reality.

The mobile phone accessory -- constructed using a series of 3D-printed rubber layers, some screws and a pair of optical lens -- has a 110-degree field of view and uses the phoneâ€™s gyroscope to track motion in as many as 9 different axes.

Altergaze is currently running a campaign on Kickstarter(Opens in a new window) and has amassed almost half of their $42,000 goal with 29 days left at the time of writing.

The company plans on making the 3D printing design open-source for non-commercial use. Designers will be able to tinker with the design. Anyone with a 3D printer can become an admin user and embed the Altergaze Online Customization Tool onto their website, allowing their users to customize and create their own Altergaze goggles.

Altergaze will supply the lenses to any admin user and charge a small royalty fee for any devices sold at the end of the year.

If a Kickstarter backer donates $125, they will receive Altergaze when the campaign ends, though Antoni explicitly states on Altergaze's website(Opens in a new window) that the donation amount doesnâ€™t reflect the actual cost of the product.

People close to the situation tell Mashable that Comedy Central hated the prospect of losing him, but with no open slot in its lineup and the price-tag he was commanding, they couldn't work out anything.

Oliver signed a deal last November to go over to HBO for Last Week Tonight With John Oliver, a weekly news digest that premieres two weeks from Sunday. He made that deal with no knowledge that Colbert was quietly making plans to move out at the end of 2014. Is he kicking himself now? Maybe, but that HBO money will soften the blow.

Is Comedy Central kicking itself? Sure. But it has options and a proven track record of turning secondary characters into full-time stars, Colbert being the alpha example. What's more, the cable network has a golden opportunity here to quiet the chorus that's was clamoring for the diversification of late-night -- before CBS confirmed an exclusive Mashable report that Colbert was the choice.

Current Daily Show correspondents Aasif Mandvi and Samantha Bee are established enough for a step up, and would be hailed among the diversity-first crowd, as would alum Wyatt Cenac, who built a following but left the show in late 2012. Larry Wilmore's devastatingly droll schtick seems too narrow for a full broadcast, while Jessica Williams and Al Madrigal are still too green to be considered contenders. The network loves Amy Schumer, but her show is just getting off the ground; and with an opportunity to truly innovate, it's unlikely that Comedy Central would just shuffle an existing show into Stewart's lead-out.

From outside the Comedy Central bubble, Aisha Tyler and Aziz Ansari's names have come up, while Chelsea Handler, once rumored for a CBS slot, seems an odd fit for the network's stable -- as well as the newsy formula that's worked so well in that slot.

Some have suggested that Chris Hardwick's @midnight could shift a half-hour earlier, but that would be stealing Peter's jokes to get a giggle out of Paul. The show is progressing nicely at its midnight slot, and its hashtag wars are dominating Twitter despite the late hour. Plus, how awkward would it be to call the show @11:30?

Handicapping on this one has only just begun, and Comedy Central execs won't have nearly the lead time that CBS did in their search to replace Letterman. But make no mistake: When the network does finally name its replacement for The Colbert Report--which is absolutely, positively not going to be The Colbert Report or anything like it -- the choice will mean at least as much as the one CBS just made.

Maybe more.

That's why when Cameron responded to a question on Saturday about making films using a virtual-reality device such as the Oculus Rift, many ears in the tech and filmmaking community will likely perk up.

[seealso slug=""oculus-rift-documentary""]

""I personally would be very interested to find a way to incorporate VR and a narrative-filmmaking experience,"" Cameron said during a Reddit Ask Me Anything session(Opens in a new window). ""So a narrative directed experience that has individuated pathways where you have choices that you make in real-time, I think that would be a lot of fun. I think it would be very technically daunting and expensive, to do it as the same quality level as a typical feature, but it would be fun to experiment with.""

But don't get too excited about the prospect of a virtual-reality Avatar coming anytime soon.

""It sounds like a lot of fun,"" the director said. ""I don't think it would take over the feature film market though. I'm very familiar with VR, but I haven't seen the specific Oculus Rift device.""

Nevertheless, Cameron will get his hands on the Oculus Rift soon -- an experience that generally seems to get users even more excited about the technology.

""I'm interested in it,"" Cameron said. ""I'm meant to see it some time in the next month or so, but I've been familiar with VR since its inception. In fact, virtual reality is a way of describing the way we work on Avatar, we work in a virtual workspace all day long. We use a 'virtual camera' which is how I create all the shots that are CG in the film, a window into a virtual reality that completely surrounds me.""

If the director's history with technology is any indication, if and when he does decide to delve into virtual reality, it will likely be on his own terms, using specialized equipment developed by his own team.

One question posed by an AMA participant, which focused on Cameron's extensive experience with deep-sea diving, may be of interest to those following the search for Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 in the Indian Ocean.

Previous rumors of an Amazon phone have generally focused on its mobile ecommerce possibilities, but this report includes tantalizingly specific details.

7006367,Boatbound: Airbnb of Boats Makes Getting on the Water Easy,"Eric Collins spent three years watching diners dock their boats at Sam's Anchor Cafe, the waterfront establishment where he works on San Francisco Bay, but could never afford to buy his own -- until now. The San Franciscan purchased a Chris Craft Launch 25(Opens in a new window) three weeks ago, only after learning that he could subsidize the cost on a peer-to-peer (or as the company calls it, ""pier-to-pier"") boat-sharing service.

[seealso slug=""edible-boat-powered-by-alcohol""]

Boatbound(Opens in a new window), essentially an Airbnb for boats, has been steadily growing since its launch in 2012. The site is fresh off a recent financing round that raised $2.5 million, and lists nearly 2,000 boats -- a far cry from the approximately 20 it started with. But perhaps more importantly than its financial success, Boatbound is making boating more accessible to the public.

""I think there was a lot of latent demand for this,"" Aaron Hall, Boatbound founder and CEO, told Mashable. ""People wanted a boat, they just couldn't figure out how to do it.""

The general premise is one we've seen before: Renters can book boats (for a fee) that owners have listed on the site. Instead of staying in a loft in SoHo or an English flat, however, wannabe Captain Jack Sparrows can spend time on the open waters without breaking the bank on a craft of their own. Listings include prices set by owners, photos, descriptions, a calendar of available dates and a space for renters to post reviews of different listings. The cheapest boats on the site are kayaks and canoes that go for about $25 a day. The most expensive, at $18,000 a day, is the 122-foot yacht that was featured on The Lonely Island's 2009 ""I'm On a Boat""(Opens in a new window) video. Yes, you, too, can be a on a boat.

""It's really going to make it a lot easier and a lot [more] stress free,"" Collins told Mashable. ""I get to spend time doing something I enjoy and helping other people, too.""

Cost and time are two of the biggest deterrents to boat ownership. The price of the initial purchase can vary wildly depending on the type of boat (not all of them are hundreds of thousands of dollars). But when you factor in things such as gasoline, storage and general repairs -- which can take huge chunks of time out of your day -- renting a boat only when you want to use it may seem like the preferable option. Boatbound can also offset costs for owners, much like renting out a vacation home on weekends you're not there. Plus, it's an easy way to test out a boat you may be thinking of purchasing.

""Buying a boat is really tough,"" Scott Croft, a spokesman for the Boat Owners Association of the United States(Opens in a new window), told Mashable. ""I think this helps people who may be on the fence of boat ownership. It lets them test the waters.""

Hall came up with the idea for Boatbound out of personal necessity. He grew up boating, but on a trip to visit family in Texas two years ago, he couldn't find a boat available for rent despite the many that were sitting unused at a nearby marina. His team in Palo Alto, Calif. was working on a wedding-related startup at the time, but changed course once Hall pitched his idea for a boat-sharing service. The biggest hurdle was insurance: It took six months to set up a system given that boats aren't as standardized as vehicles such as cars, for which there is an established rental industry.

There are more than 12 million registered recreational boats in the United States, according to a 2012 National Marine Manufacturers Association study(Opens in a new window). However, the average boat is only used for approximately 17 days during the year, according to a 2011 United States Coast Guard study(Opens in a new window).

You don't need any experience to use Boatbound, but some states have stricter regulations than others about licenses and other qualifications. Sometimes owners, such as Tom Cavers(Opens in a new window) in San Francisco, will teach renters about their craft before handing it over, especially if the newly minted seafarers don't have much experience. Some boats can now be booked with a certified captain if renters simply want to enjoy the ride.

""The first time someone rents, we spend about half an hour on the boat going through everything, how it works, talking through sailing on San Francisco Bay and where they're going to go,"" Cavers told Mashable.

These interactions can create long-lasting friendships. Teresa Fitzsimmons, who owns a boat(Opens in a new window) in south Florida, said she still keeps in touch with almost everyone who has rented her craft. Fitzsimmons' partner even made a business connection through Boatbound; she works for a large healthcare company, and it just so happened that a major player in the industry's San Francisco market rented their boat. This focus on community is part of Hall's plan for Boatbound. There are events such as local meetups and owner-appreciation days, he said, adding that the company is working on more ways to enhance the boating experience.

Similar services include Incredibule(Opens in a new window), GetMyBoat(Opens in a new window) and Cruzin(Opens in a new window), among others, but according to Croft, Boatbound appears to be leading the pack. The site has raised $4.2 million in total to date. Hall said its most recent round of funding will be used to expand its reach within the United States and internationally, as well as to focus on existing markets. Currently, boats can be posted from anywhere in the world, but listings are still concentrated in a few areas such as San Francisco and south Florida.

To date, Boatbound has had $3.5 million in planned bookings, according to a press release(Opens in a new window). It has also been building relationships with organizations such as BoatUS, the American Sailing Association(Opens in a new window) and the Brunswick Corporation(Opens in a new window). The site itself underwent a recent redesign to make it more accessible to mobile users since 30% to 40% of people access it on the go, according Hall.

""It amazed me how quickly people wanted to make this a great thing,"" Hall said. ""We wanted to make people feel like they were a part of something, and I think we've done that.""",4/12/2014 0:00,0.593361,3,2,0,4.741036,9,00000,0,4245.248,1926.741,7100,0.418233,0.069268,0.051793,0.027888,0.7,-0.12955,4600
7026380,Firsthand Proof That Brazil Is World Cup Soccer's True Home,"The 2014 World Cup officially kicks off in Brazil two months from Saturday. Off-the-pitch worries -- massive protests and crime chief among them -- are well-founded, to be sure. But when it comes to soccer itself and how Brazilians regard the beautiful game, Brazil is the World Cup's one true home.

You'll hear this over and over between now and June 12 -- but forget all that vague pontification. We have firsthand proof.

[seealso url = ""http://mashable.com/2014/03/30/world-cup-usmnt-mls-players""]

I had the good fortune of attending a very-big-deal soccer match at the Maracana, Rio de Janeiro's legendary stadium that will host the World Cup final on July 13, at the end of a long backpacking trip through South America in 2008. In 28 years of attending all range of sports events at multiple levels in multiple countries, the Maracana on the night of June 4, 2008, remains the single most insane atmosphere I've ever witnessed. And I use ""insane"" in the most complimentary way possible.

More than an hour before the match was even scheduled to start, fans had already filled the Maracana (capacity: 96,000!) nearly to capacity. Fans from both sides -- Rio-based host Fluminense and the visiting Boca Juniors of Buenos Aires, Argentina -- chanted. Loudly. Then they chanted more, and louder. And more. And louder. Some beat drums. Others waved a total of hundreds, if not thousands, of balloons.

The vibe was aggressive and manically passionate, but didn't feel dangerous. This despite flares burning in the stands and at times rendering visibility near zero thanks to their smoke. Firecrackers were also popular. No celebratory fan accessory, it seemed, was off limits.

Below is a 30-second video I shot on my camera. I was sitting behind one goal; the flashes and flares you see in the distance through the smoke are coming from fans clear across the stadium. Perhaps you can catch little glimpses of field through the madness.

Now here's a clearer, longer and slightly tamer look at the pre-game madness. The old Brazilian man dancing to my right, who makes his first appearance about five seconds in ,was pretty much the coolest guy ever.

Why all the fuss? This match mattered. Fluminense and Boca Juniors were squaring off in the second leg of their Copa Libertadores semifinal matchup. The Copa Libertadores -- the South American equivalent of Europe's Champions League -- takes the top teams from each domestic league to create one continent-wide mega-tournament every year. The winner of this matchup would go on to the Copa Libertadores finals. The loser's season would be over.

Boca Juniors is probably the most iconic club in South America, so Fluminense supporters were extra motivated to roll out their best un-welcome mat. And here's the topper: Fluminense and Boca had tied 2-2 during the first leg of their semifinal a week before, meaning that this second leg was for all the marbles -- whoever won here was booking a ticket to the final, period.

A father and his two young kids -- a boy and a girl-- sat in the row in front of me. They were Brazilian, and all three were decked out in Fluminense's deep red and green colors. Both son and daughter looked to be somewhere between seven and ten years old. ""How sweet,"" I thought to myself. ""What a great family outing. And especially cool that this adorable little girl and her dad can bond over sports like this.""

A little later, the Boca supporters launched into an impassioned chant from their sideline section to our left. That cute little girl reacted like this, which floored me completely:

#YOLO girl flips a double birdie at the Maracana on June 4, 2008. Credit: Sam Laird

In the 57th minute(Opens in a new window), Boca's MartÃ­n Palermo scored to put his squad up 1-0. This was very bad news for the dedicated masses inside the Maracana, putting their dream of moving on to the final in serious jeopardy. But then -- an equalizer!

Fluminense's Washington (yes, rocking the one name thing) scored on a free kick in the 62nd minute to tie the game. Suddenly Fluminense and its tens of thousands of supporters in attendance had new hope. And new hope, at least in this case, meant complete bedlam.

I caught the goal and subsequent celebration on camera; it's embedded below. At about the 20-second mark, you'll see a particularly hearty Fluminense supporter gesticulating madly. He spent much of his post-goal adrenaline flipping off the Boca sections to our left with great gusto. You'll also have to excuse the shoddy camera work right after the goal, as I (and many others) had just accidentally been doused in beer.

Less than 10 minutes later, an own-goal by Boca gave Fluminense the lead, and released more joyous chaos. Then another Fluminense score in stoppage time put the nail in Boca's coffin and provided the 3-1 final score.

But after the final whistle, a funny thing happened: No one wanted to go home. Cheering, chanting, hugging, kissing, drinking, taunting -- these all seemed more appealing options than leaving the Maracana. Here's the post-win scene (shout out the guy taking a selfie at 2:15 -- truly a man ahead of his time):

Fluminense would go on to lose in the finals to Ecuadorean side LDU Quito, but their fans that night will always be winners in my book.

The 2014 World Cup, the first time the tournament has been held in Brazil since 1950, kicks off June 12. And now you know why it feels like too long to wait.

Bee bearding is a global pursuit, but it's especially popular in the city of Chongqing in southwestern China, where She is from. There, other local honey merchants regularly cover themselves head to toe in bees.

The process of attracting the bees in bee bearding starts with placing a queen bee in a small cage that hangs from the person's body. Eventually, the bees swarm over the participant's body. In this case, Ping was only protected by a plastic bag over his head.

""To be honest, I felt very nervous, but I do it to promote my honey,"" She told the AFP(Opens in a new window). ""I'm used to dealing with bees and started these activities when I was about 22.""

Stephen Colbert, I have a T-bone to pick with you.

Your deliberate French pronunciation of our surname has caused a great deal of trouble in my life since your first appearance on The Daily Show. I'm Team Bert, not Team Bear. Col-bert (me) versus Col-bear (you) might seem like the silliest French-versus-American word battle since Freedom Fries.

But you see, it matters. The hard ""T"" ends our name with a diction kick instead of a snooty whimper.

And now, your new gig as Late Show host (which is super awesome -- congrats!) means that I'll have to continue to correct mispronunciations of my name for years.

The battle for Bert has even affected my work life:

And the thing is, Stephen, even your family wants you to ride your bald eagle back to the Bert side.

In 2013, your sister, Elizabeth Colbert Busch(Opens in a new window), ran for political office in South Carolina, proudly adhering a hard ""T"" to the end of her name. The Internet says that you didn't adopt the soft ""T"" pronunciation until attending college(Opens in a new window) at Northwestern University in Illinois.

Why change it, really? Pronouncing Colbert like ""Col-bear"" is like putting a Lexus hood ornament on a Subaru. Or adding bedazzles to your Hawaiian shirt. Or wearing an ascot instead of tie. No one likes ascots.

You already said you plan to keep your fancy-schmancy French pronunciation, but just know that as your popularity grows, the Col-berts of the world will fight harder for the hard T.

6431290,Scientists Discover Evidence of a New Type of Matter: the Tetraquark,"The recent identification of a long-theorized particle provides strong evidence of a new form of matter.

Scientists working on the Large Hadron Collider, the most powerful particle collider in the world, verified the existence of a particle(Opens in a new window) called Z(4430) last week, according to New Scientist. Previously, physicists had reasoned that the particle could exist but had yet to observe it.

[seealso slug=""cern-god-particle-higgs-boson""]

Discovery of any new particle is an important step for scientists, but Z(4430) is viewed with particular importance -- it is evidence of a new type of matter called a tetraquark.

Quarks are among the most basic building blocks of matter. Combinations of different types of quarks produce protons and neutrons. Although quarks typically bind together in groups of two or three, scientists had theorized that four quarks could be combined to form a different type of matter: the tetraquark.

The discovery has particular importance for our understanding of neutron stars, according to space-news site Universe Today(Opens in a new window), which wrote:

""With the existence of tetraquarks, it is possible for neutrons within the core to interact strongly enough to create tetraquarks. This could even lead to the production of pentaquarks and hexaquarks, or even that quarks could interact individually without being bound into color neutral particles. This would produce a hypothetical object known as a quark star.""",4/12/2014 0:00,0.392447,33,21,0,4.355892,10,Lifestyle,0,8409.529,3077.934,2200,0.546719,0.238009,0.059713,0.018312,0.5,0.3,4000
7024145,64% of World's Extreme Poor Live in Just 5 Countries,"The World Bank Group (WBG) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) continue to hold their annual spring meetings in Washington, D.C., this weekend. Thousands of government officials and and NGOs are there to discuss the global economy and international development.

Gearing up for the event, the WBG released a new report(Opens in a new window) Thursday. It focuses on the progress that has been made in reducing global poverty, and what challenges remain.

Using the most recent data from 2010, the report shows that nearly two-thirds of the extremely poor -- that is, those who live on less than $1.25 a day -- live in just five countries: India, China, Nigeria, Bangladesh and the Democratic Republic of Congo.

The report also makes sure to note that there are smaller countries with very high extreme poverty rates, including Liberia, Burundi, Madagascar and Zambia. A more detailed version will be released later this year.

Global poverty as a whole is in decline. In 1990, 36% of the world's population lived in extreme poverty; in 2010, that number decreased to 18%. This year, the WBG President set an interim target to reduce global poverty to 9% by 2020.

Kyiv Post, a Ukrainian English-language news organization, said the takeover appeared(Opens in a new window) to be a Russian military operation similar to the invasion of Crimea last month, involving men in fatigues carrying Kalashnikov assault rifles. Gunmen reportedly established checkpoints outside the city of 125,000, and appeared to be searching vehicles for weapons, Kyiv Post reported.

Russia supporters also reportedly tried to take the police station in Shakhtarsk, another city in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine, that effort apparently failed. In addition, a group of young people armed with wooden bats briefly took over a floor of the general prosecutor's office in the city of Donetsk, Reuters reported.(Opens in a new window) They later left after talks, Donetsk police said in a statement.

Later in the day, the Interior Ministry in Donetsk was also seized by gunmen, Kyiv Post reported(Opens in a new window). It said the swiftness of the attacks suggested â€œthat operation was planned well in advance and had support from within the ranks of Ukraine's government, including its law enforcement agencies.â€

Russia-based media outlet RT published this video of the police headquarters takeover in Sloviansk, and the hoisting of a Russian flag over its entrance:

Another video showed the mayor of Sloviansk, Nelya Shtepa, addressing the crowd that had gathered near the police headquarters. An account by Russiaâ€™s Interfax news agency(Opens in a new window) said Shtepa assured residents that the takeover posed no threat to them. The occupiers are on the people's side, she reportedly said; they are showing their disagreement with the Kiev authorities.

In addition, several reports emerged of military jets flying over cities in eastern Ukraine.

The seizure of buildings by pro-Russian separatists ratchets up East-West tension over the fate of Ukraine. Earlier this week, NATO released images showing a significant buildup of Russian military equipment and troops along the Ukraine border.

NATO officials said there are 40,000 Russian troops amassed along the border, raising fears of an imminent invasion on a scale that would dwarf Moscowâ€™s takeover of Crimea.

Comparisons with Crimea resonated on Saturday, as correspondents and other observers noted that the gunmen who took over the police station in Sloviansk wore similar camouflage uniforms, and carried the same weaponry as those who occupied Crimea.

In addition, several journalists reported being harassed and roughed-up by the gunmen, as other reporters had been during the Crimea takeover.

7004062,Hackathons Are the New Career Fairs,"For those looking to score a job at a hot tech startup or a coveted spot with a tech behemoth like Facebook or Square, the job search scene has an up-and-coming competitor to the traditional career fair: hackathons.

Readyforce(Opens in a new window), a career network for college students, aims to hone in on hackathons as an outlet for job seekers. The platform streamlines the process of connecting students with companies and organizations recruiting those with computer science and computer engineering backgrounds. Readyforce's new platform, HackerHub(Opens in a new window), launched this spring. Readyforce CEO Alex Mooradian(Opens in a new window) hopes the hub will serve as a one-stop shop for student leaders and companies.

Hackathons are talent hunting grounds

Mooradian estimates around 20,000 students will participate in the about 45 hackathons this spring. These events typically cater to college students, but a select few are aimed at high school students(Opens in a new window). More still include high school participants on a case-by-case basis.

Hackathons are ideal hunting grounds for companies looking to score top talent straight out of school. They are often more appealing than a traditional career fair, as companies can send their engineers to an event and get a first-hand glimpse at potential candidates and their skills.

Credit: Simon Tunbridge

""Thereâ€™s a wave of companies saying, 'All weâ€™re doing is hackathons; thatâ€™s the only thing that we care about right now because those are the students we know are going to make an immediate impact,'"" says Mooradian.

Students in the upper echelons of computer science or engineering fields are often highly sought after. ""These are the doers, the students doing things outside of the classroom -â€“ theyâ€™re taking the initiative to start their own projects,"" says Mooradian. ""Theyâ€™re the kind of students you can hire who, in some cases, are as experienced as an engineer who has years of experience, because some of them have been coding since they were 10."" Companies seeking to hire such talent may want to consider hackathons as a way of making an impression on these candidates, and determining which students are the best fit for their companies.

Connecting students and post-grad opportunities

HackerHub functions as a platform that connects students to companies beyond the big names -- the Googles, MongoDBs(Opens in a new window) and SendGrids(Opens in a new window) -- that are likely already plugged in to the hackathon scene.

Credit: Readyforce

""We launched HackerHub in order to help students get the word out to the larger population,"" says Mooradian, adding that the platform is useful for everything from ""mega"" hackathons (LA Hacks(Opens in a new window), Hack Illinois(Opens in a new window), etc.) to niche events, such as smaller hackathons geared specifically toward women programmers(Opens in a new window), or region-specific(Opens in a new window) events.

To get started on the platform, student leaders can learn about partnering with Readyforce here(Opens in a new window). Once signed up, they can invite all hackathon participants to join what Mooradian describes as a ""virtual resume book,"" a group of Readyforce profiles. Students then import their resumes or LinkedIn profiles, add pictures or videos of the projects they're working on, link GitHub accounts and build out their profiles. Then, about a week after the event, student leaders can share the virtual resume compilations with various companies signed with Readyforce.

Companies -- which can create profiles here(Opens in a new window) of their own -- can search for students by name, skill set, graduation date and more, and then connect directly on the platform. Companies may also opt to sponsor a hackathon, which lets them work side-by-side with participants, give ""tech talks,"" provide mentorship or advice and promote their specific APIs. Companies can also subscribe to the HackerHub calendar to get updates when a new event is announced.

Mooradian says Readyforce helped forge more than 20,000 connections between students and companies since the beginning of 2014. ""Weâ€™re all about helping students launch amazing careers,"" he says.

7026248,Neil Young's Long Fight to Restore the Quality of Music,"Neil Young has been disappointed by the sound of his own music for more than 30 years.

Back in 1982, Young listened to some of his songs on a CD for the first time and couldn't help but ""question what had happened"" to the sound quality. CDs had just come to market that year and some, like Young, believed there was a noticeable drop in quality from vinyl and certainly from what was heard in the recording studio. That fidelity only worsened in the years that followed as the industry shifted to mp3 downloads and streaming music. The evolution, or devolution, of music formats weighed on him.

""I felt really guilty about selling mp3s,"" Young told Mashable in an interview earlier this month. ""People were paying for this thing that was only a fraction of what I created... It sounds so compromised that you really don't get the feeling of the music. You don't get into the depth of the music and get the soul of it because there's not enough of it there.""

Sometime ""around the turn of the century,"" Young says, he began thinking about the sound quality problem more. He thought about trying to introduce a cloud-based music system for higher-quality tracks, but realized the bandwidth wasn't there. He considered a download model that would work on smartphones, but came to believe the system required a dedicated music player. At one point, Young even talked with Apple's visionary cofounder Steve Jobs about the project, but he says Jobs believed ""an iPod was as good as it needed to be for what it was.""

""He was right, but he went home and listened to vinyl,"" Young says of Jobs' thinking, with a laugh. He didn't even bother to have conversations with other top tech executives. ""They were succeeding. They were selling lots of mp3s,"" he explains. ""People had never heard anything else. What's the problem? There was no problem.""

About three years ago, Young started laying the foundation for a standalone company called PonoMusic (pono means ""righteousness"" in Hawaiian) that would develop an ecosystem for high-quality digital music. The first product, a Toblerone-shaped device, would let users store 1,000-2,000 digital albums of studio master quality music that they would be purchased through a dedicated online marketplace. In essence, it would function like an iPod to give music listeners of all types access to the sweet, full sounds of vinyl or better.

The Pono music player would be like Young himself: something very much out of time.

The worst kept secret

When John Hamm (not to be confused with Mad Men's Jon Hamm) was first introduced to Young through one of the company's board members a little over a year ago, PonoMusic was only a ""business"" in the loosest sense of the word. It consisted of a very small staff, rotated through a couple CEOs and had yet to advance beyond the prototyping stage for a product.

""There was no business plan. There was no real financing plan. There was no sense of what the brand would be,"" says Hamm, who eventually took over as CEO of PonoMusic. "" Neil was focused on a lot of things that were part of his mission, but that didn't have a realistic grounding in a business idea.""

Few musicians command as much respect as Neil Young. Over the course of a recording career spanning six decades, he has sold millions of records, been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and influenced artists ranging from Bob Dylan to Pearl Jam. But his success recording music hasn't always translated to success starting businesses.

Young invested in Lionel Trains and later invented a couple products for the company based on his love of model trains. As David Carr wrote in a 2012 profile(Opens in a new window) of Young in The New York Times, ""Young lost a lot of money on his investment, but heâ€™s still a board member at Lionel and ended up with a lot of cool gear, so it all sort of worked out.""

The man who wrote the lyrics ""don't let it bring you down, it's only castles burning,"" is unsurprisingly not overly concerned about his business acumen or lack thereof. ""I only do what I'm interested in,"" he says. ""I just let the rest of it take care of itself."" Young did choose to surround himself with a few business advisors to set up PonoMusic and picked Hamm to run the day-to-day operations so that Neil Young can do what Neil Young does best: come up with ideas and connect with musicians and music fans.

That hasn't stopped Young from pitching ideas that would be questionable for the business. According to Hamm, Young was interested in bringing bluetooth or Wi-fi to the music player and even pursue a ""second screen video"" experience, both of which would be costly and difficult for the first-generation device.

""We just said to Neil, 'These are all great ideas, but they need to come at their logical place in the evolution of the product,'"" Hamm says. ""The key was to ship a product this calendar year.""

Part of the reason for the rush is that Young had already gone on a media blitz for the Pono player back in 2012, talking about it in his autobiography(Opens in a new window), in the 2012 New York Times profile and even showing off an early version of the device during an appearance on The Late Show With David Letterman.

""It was one of the worst kept secrets in the world,"" Hamm says. Now the company needed to actually deliver a product.

Kickstarter success

After narrowing down the focus for a first-generation product, Hamm and the PonoMusic team made the decision over the winter to simultaneously do a public launch for the company, its website and a Kickstarter campaign at SXSW in March.

Even by recent Kickstarter standards, the Pono campaign(Opens in a new window) has a jaw-dropping number of stars. In a promo video, Arcade Fire, Tom Petty, Norah Jones, Eddie Vedder, David Crosby and others all talk about the ear-opening experience of using Pono for the first time. The inevitable press, and perhaps the novel idea, paid off.

The Pono Kickstarter campaign hit its $800,000 funding goal in just one day. Contribution options range from $5 in exchange for a Thank You note on Pono's website to $400 to preorder the device to $5,000 to have a VIP listening party with Young. The campaign is now closing in on $6 million from more than 17,000 backers with four days to go, making it the third most successful Kickstarter campaign ever.

The goal of the campaign wasn't to raise funds but rather to raise awareness by introducing the idea to a broader audience. Hamm says the company did quietly raise funding through traditional means to finance getting the player to prototype stage as well as setting up contracts with the major record labels. PonoMusic had been in talks with about 10 parties for a followup funding round, but he says ""they probably wouldn't have been deals we would have liked at that point."" Following the success of the Kickstarter campaign, the company is seeing more investor interest. The plan is to do an equity financing round in May or June.

The next step for PonoMusic will be to make good on delivering pre-ordered devices starting in October as well as to build up its content library of high-quality tracks provided by the major and independent labels. Beyond that, the company is evaluating whether and how to innovate with home stereo systems to car systems. The team argues that the Kickstarter campaign is validation that there is a market for high-quality music beyond just a handful of audiophiles.

""I'm gratified by the amount of pledges that we've had,"" Young says. ""It's going to be challenging for us to keep up with the demand for Pono now that we have the ball rolling, but we will do it.""

Pono is the third most funded Kickstarter campaign ever, behind the Pebble smartwatch and Ouya game console. Credit:

Keep on rockin' with or without Pono

Despite the success that PonoMusic has had on Kickstarter, some industry watchers doubt its market potential.

""Convenience trumps quality,"" says James McQuivey, VP and principal analyst with Forrester Research. ""It's why mp3 works. It's why streaming works."" It's possible, he argues, that Pono could eventually attract a user base in the hundreds of thousands and become a ""sustainable niche"" business, but he doesn't expect it to ever achieve mass market success.

Young remains confident about Pono's potential and will continue to invest much -- though not all -- of his time in the company. ""I think Pono is going to take a lot of time and a lot of dedication,"" Young says. ""At the same time, I continue to play my concerts and write songs and they don't seem to get in each other's way. ""

From the beginning, he has had a bigger goal in mind than simply launching a business. He wants to show consumers that there is another option for listening to music beyond mp3s. Regardless of what happens with Pono, Young believes he has already succeeded on that mission.",4/12/2014 0:00,0.502693,6,1,0,4.576241,7,Business,2173.808,4772.885,3088.22,3800,0.486432,0.086382,0.047872,0.026596,0,0,1800

7006208,Can You Renege on a Job Offer Once You've Accepted?,"Whether itâ€™s

But what if that perfect job offer(Opens in a new window) comes in before you even start your current job? What do you do if youâ€™ve already confirmed youâ€™ll start at another company -- and then in waltzes â€œThe One?â€ Can you renege on a job offer that youâ€™ve already accepted?

This is a tough question, and unfortunately, there really isnâ€™t a clear-cut answer. Sure, you can legally renege on a job offer -- at-will employment means you can technically leave at the drop of a hat -- but thereâ€™s much more to consider before you turn down one company for another.

Here are a few things to think about if you have a new offer -- plus one smart way to make sure youâ€™re never in the â€œshould I or shouldnâ€™t I?â€ situation ever again.

The rule of thumb

Consider this: The hiring process is long and hard, and once youâ€™ve interviewed, been offered a job, and accepted, your future bosses are likely breathing a sigh of relief, high-fiving, and sending rejection letters to all of the other candidates.

So you can imagine how theyâ€™ll feel when they have to start the process all over again.

While you may think that youâ€™ll never have to see these people again, the fact is that recruiters move around from company to company, so you have no idea how far your reputation will spread. The repercussions are impossible to measure, and while you may get lucky, you also might be irreversibly damaging your professional reputation. Not a risk you want to take.

In other words, in most situations itâ€™s generally unwise to renege on a job offer. And before you say, â€œBut my dream companyâ€¦!â€ remember that, ideally, your dream company will continue to exist for many years. The recruiter you worked with will likely be understanding if you explain that you love the company and hope to maintain the relationship for future opportunities, but that youâ€™ve already made a commitment to another. Showing integrity during this process leaves a good impression -- and will put you in a good place to apply again a few years down the road.

But what if itâ€™s unavoidable?

Of course, there are always extenuating circumstances that go beyond having another offer -- maybe you have a parent who lives across the country and suddenly falls ill or your spouse has just been transferred to another state.

In cases like these, communication and honesty are key in going back to your new employer and explaining why you wonâ€™t be able to join the team after all. Life happens, and most people will see this is beyond your control, especially if your reasoning is genuine and not a ploy to accept a more tempting offer. Youâ€™ll need to make it very clear that it is not for lack of excitement about the job or company that is making you have second thoughts -- itâ€™s the unavoidable situation you find yourself in.

Preferably, you should have this conversation in person or at least over the phone. And, it never hurts to follow up that conversation with a gracious thank-you note to the office thanking them for the opportunity to work together.

How to never renege again

Besides reneging or not reneging, thereâ€™s the oft-underutilized third option: pushing for more time to make a decision about a position youâ€™re not sure about. Hereâ€™s the thing: If youâ€™ve been offered a job but have another, more enticing job opportunity in the works, do not accept it. Sure, itâ€™s understandable to not want to give up the safety net of having a job offer, but itâ€™ll put you in a much less awkward position down the line if you negotiate for more time.

A good way to approach this is to first thank the employer for the opportunity when you receive the verbal offer. Rather than accepting the offer, explain that having the opportunity to speak with a few more people in the company to learn about the culture or projects would be really helpful in making your decision. This will naturally take a bit more time than simply making a decision, so this is a reasonable time to suggest a deadline that is more favorable to your timeline. Most companies will appreciate that you are interested in doing the due diligence to make sure you are a good fit(Opens in a new window) -- and you can still maintain a safety net without setting yourself up to burn bridges as you await the job offer from your dream company.",4/12/2014 0:00,0.491482,30,5,10,4.692816,6,Entertainment,0,17800,5748.385,4666.667,0.45712,0.14253,0.046243,0.012386,0,0,2000
6482469,"A-List Investors, 1 Million Downloads: Is Selfie App 'Shots' For Real?","There are two days that Shots(Opens in a new window) CEO John Shahidi says he will never forget.

The first happened in December of 2011, when Shahidi was still running the mobile gaming company RockLive. He woke up to find one of his company's top mobile games, Heads Up, had crashed inexplicably. After quickly scanning Twitter to see what the game's users were saying, he found the problem.

[seealso slug=""best-free-iphone-apps/""]

Justin Bieber had played the game and posted his top score on Twitter. The publicity had caused thousands of people to download and play the game. ""It just crashed our servers,"" Shahidi told Mashable.

It was the first time Shahidi witnessed the power of Bieber's social media influence first-hand.

The second day he'll never forget took place in March 2012. It was the day Bieber called Shahidi in hopes of becoming a RockLive investor. The only problem: Shahidi and his RockLive co-founder, his brother Sammy, didn't want to make games anymore. They were exhausted. â€œTheyâ€™d blow up, then theyâ€™d fall off the face of the earth,â€ he explains. Bieber was such a fan of RockLive that he was interested in whatever company the duo wanted to build.

They wanted to make something that would last and, ultimately, make a difference. They had the power of Bieber's social media reach, and they wanted to put it to good use. So with Bieber as an investor, they left RockLive behind and created Shots Mobile and its first app Shots, a social network that specializes in one kind of photo sharing experience: the selfie.

Check out @MadisonElleBeer(Opens in a new window)â€™s #selfie(Opens in a new window) on @shots(Opens in a new window) http://t.co/fdEhtVL2Wq(Opens in a new window) pic.twitter.com/plzT4ovO13(Opens in a new window)â€” Justin Bieber (@justinbieber) April 9, 2014(Opens in a new window)

Shots, which launched in November, is an app that allows users to post a selfie to their followers, much like other social media apps like Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat or Instagram. The major difference is that Shahidi wanted to build something safe for teenagers -- a social site where bullies don't exist and posting a selfie doesn't prompt criticism from friends or strangers.

The app only allows a user's friends to comment, and only if they share a selfie of their own along with it. (People can't hide behind the keyboard, he explains.) Only the front-facing camera works within the app, and you can't upload from the camera roll. That ensures people are taking photos in real-time, capturing their true identities, says Shahidi. Anyone reported for bullying is instantly kicked off the app.

The Shots iOS app launched in November, and announced one million downloads last week. Credit: Shots/App Store

This anti-bullying approach is personal for Shahidi, who says that even at the age of 34 he is still bullied online. After being bullied as a child, the social media abuse as an adult was a reminder of how that felt growing up. He is still teased about his weight, and for being a momma's boy of sorts. Before moving to the Bay Area last August, Shahidi had never lived more than two miles from his mother, who raised him and his brother by herself.

â€œ[Online bullying is] nothing thatâ€™s going to make me want to hurt myself, but going back to someone whoâ€™s 20 years younger than me -- 14 or 15 years old -- they are hurting themselves,"" says Shahidi.

The challenge behind marketing a ""bully free"" app is to make it cool, says Shahidi. Luckily, Shots has an investor who can make anything cool for teenagers. When Shots first launched, 90% of its user base also followed Bieber on Twitter. That number is now down to 20%, which Shahidi believes is a testament to the app's functionality.

How far, though, can an app solely focused on selfies really go? Pretty far, if you ask Shahidi.

The company announced 1 million downloads on Thursday, and gets 750,000 active users per month. Bieber and fellow investor Floyd Mayweather, the boxer, help market the app regularly by sharing selfies to their millions of Twitter followers. Shots also has the audience coveted by social networks everywhere: teenagers.

Three quarters of Shots users are females under the age of 24.

Shots is not the only selfie style app making headlines. Frontback(Opens in a new window) is also making a name for itself, with high profile celeb users like Ashton Kutcher, Snoop Lion (formerly Snoop Dogg) and Twitter cofounder Jack Dorsey.

http://t.co/RiUK9jYyYa(Opens in a new window) #selfie(Opens in a new window) http://t.co/1yCq05xk7g(Opens in a new window) pic.twitter.com/QpYKoZx0Ho(Opens in a new window)â€” Floyd Mayweather (@FloydMayweather) April 7, 2014(Opens in a new window)

Although Shots is nowhere near the top photo and video iOS apps in the U.S., Shahidi points to other countries like Brazil and Mexico where the app is routinely in the top 50 in the same category, according to App Annie(Opens in a new window). Currently, the app is also only available on iOS, but an Android version is in the works, says Shahidi.

With stalwarts like Facebook and Twitter rolling out new features on a near-weekly basis, making it in the social network industry is no small challenge. But Shahidi is up for the challenge, and believes users will see the difference in a network like Shots if they give it a chance.

""We're bigger than just building something with Justin,"" says Shahidi. ""This is something humanity really needs. We want to build something positive for teenagers.""

That's the unique branding dilemma facing Stephen Colbert and CBS. Colbert, who is set to take over The Late Show for the retiring David Letterman in 2015, is planning to retire the pseudo-conservative character he created for Comedy Central's Colbert Report. That means when viewers tune in to the new Late Show next year, they will be seeing ... what exactly?

[seealso slug=""stephen-colbert-is-taking-over-for-david-letterman-cbs-confirms""]

Colbert has appeared as himself several times in the past. As a series of videos on Slate(Opens in a new window) illustrate, the out-of-character Colbert is not that far off from ""Stephen Colbert,"" only less bombastic and lacking the fake right-wing politics.

While it may be a fairly easy transition to make from an entertainment standpoint, though, marketing the new Colbert will be tricky, branding experts say.

Allen Adamson, managing director of branding firm Landor Associates(Opens in a new window), likens Colbert's situation to a typecast actor taking on a new role. Early in their careers, for instance, both Woody Allen and Steve Martin were indistinguishable from their standup comedy personas, but later changed their images with more sober films. ""It's like a new product launch,"" Adamson says. He adds that CBS has two options -- keep the new Colbert under wraps to create a buzz or ""sample"" the new Colbert with out-of-character appearances.

Josh Feldmeth, CEO of Interbrand(Opens in a new window) New York, Toronto, and San Francisco, says Colbert also has to overcome his association with liberal politics. ""If you dig into the demo, there's a pretty strong ideological lean,"" he says. ""It probably doesn't match up one-to-one with the Late Show demo."" Adamson points out that late-night talk show hosts have traditionally been at least perceived as politically neutral. ""They may not have appealed to everyone, but they didn't offend anyone,"" he says. ""They were middle-of-the-road. Colbert may be polarizing.""

(Talk show host Rush Limbaugh has bolstered this assertion by declaring that CBS has ""declared war on the heartland of America"" by hiring Colbert.)

That may be the case, but Henry Schafer, EVP of The Q Scores Co.(Opens in a new window), which measures celebs' popularity, says Colbert's association with liberal politics has led to an impassioned following among the desired 18-34 year-old demo. Colbert's ranking in the Q Score, which measures the percentage of people who say a celeb is among their favorites, is higher than Jimmy Fallon's or Jimmy Kimmel's, but he's less well known.

For comparison, Tom Hanks has the highest Q Score of any celeb right now, 45 and 91% awareness. The average Q Score among late-night talk show hosts is 16 on 31% awareness.

Schafer says reintroducing Colbert won't be a big deal since he is already so beloved among that younger demo. ""That's what prompted CBS to go in that direction to clearly stay competitive,"" Schafer says. ""He's a more off-center kind of host. He has more of that polarity about him than the other two, but he's going to stir emotions, so he'll be attractive.""",4/12/2014 0:00,0.57377,10,2,0,4.770302,8,Business,0,3599.783,2314.17,654,0.507028,0.09791,0.037123,0.018561,0,0,3100

[seealso slug=""how-i-met-your-mother-barney-stinson-suits""]

Crowdemand(Opens in a new window), which launched Tuesday, uses similar methods as Kickstarter to connect designers directly with their customers. Designers will post their work on the site and during a two-week campaign period consumers will pre-order the items they want.

If a minimum number of orders are placed, the designs go to production and are shipped to customers in two to four months. All designs will fit into one of three categories: ""Celebrity Spotting,"" ""Backed by Popular Demand"" and ""New Demands.""

Credit: Crowdemand

""It's not just about sharing what you purchased, but sharing for the purpose of getting something made,"" co-CEO Yaniv Reeis told Mashable. ""We're just creating demand in a different kind of way.""

For now, only established designers will be featured on the site, a dynamic designed to minimize the risk of orders not being filled or not being of a high quality. Cynthia Rowley(Opens in a new window) will be the inaugural designer, followed by Whit(Opens in a new window) a week later and Meskita(Opens in a new window) a week after that. So far, approximately 20 designers are scheduled to appear on the site, and Reeis expects that more campaigns will overlap as Crowdemand grows.

Reeis and co-founders Marat Stary and Liat Cohen, who have all known each other since childhood, simply wanted to work together. Eventually, Crowdemand bloomed out of their shared love of design and fashion.

The site acts as a retailer, but unlike traditional online fashion sites that decide to carry certain designs based on projections and historical performance, Crowdemand allows customers to decide what they want for themselves. The founders of the site believe this on-demand system will cut down on production and inventory issues, resulting in no excess stock or wasted materials.

In addition to getting an idea of how customers respond to their pieces, the site also allows designers to see how they respond to cost. Apparel will typically cost between $250-$2,000, but some accessories may be less expensive.

Youâ€™re going to be sad in the long run, Game of Thrones fans.

[seealso slug=""joffrey-tyrion-game-of-thrones-quotes""]

Yes, King Joffrey Baratheon may have been the most vile and sadistic character in TV history. Yes, every move he made was an act of unspeakable cruelty and unchecked delusion. Yes, the little rat-faced bastard deserved to die.

To those of us who havenâ€™t read George R. R. Martinâ€™s books, Joffreyâ€™s poisoning at his wedding to Margaery Tyrell is not only lighting up the Internet with schadenfreude, but it sets up a delicious whodunit â€“ perhaps the biggest since 1980, when Dallasâ€™ â€œWho Shot J.R.?â€ episode lit up the uh, the um â€¦ the phone lines? Letter writing campaigns? Anyway, whatever they did back then.

But Iâ€™m telling you, losing Joffrey is no good. In terms of its impact on the dynamics of Game of Thrones, itâ€™ every bit as wrongheaded as Ned Stark losing his.

And here's why:

Because now the show has no clear villain

Joffrey Baratheon Credit: HBO.com

In terms of hatability, Joffrey made Darth Vader look like Mister Rogers. Just about everyone in Game of Thrones has some villainous streak, but the inbred king of the seven realms was the nastiest of them all, and he was in charge! Who are we rooting against now, exactly? When Ned Starkâ€™s sentence was carried out, we lost the show's clear alpha hero. Now that both poles have been neutralized, the big, bright compass in the sky is truly spinning with no True North -- or South.

Because his super annoying wife is probably going to be in charge

It couldnâ€™t be more obvious that Margaery Tyrell was in it for personal and political gain (she and her duplicitous grandmother, Lady Oleanna Tyrell, have to be suspects â€“ Margaery fed him that first bite of pie, right?). As the widow of Renly Baratheon, Margaery already had a claim on the Iron Throne; with the ceremony over, she very well may inheret it. But not since Anne Hathaway won her Oscar has it been this difficult to root for the success of hyperambition.

But they never consummated the marriage â€“ so is it legal?

Itâ€™s not like anyone would have dared initiate the â€œbedding ceremony,â€ but man, what a tease. With Joffreyâ€™s cruel proclivities, thereâ€™s no telling what kind of awful bullet Margaery dodged here. Whatâ€™s more, who knows what kind of ascension ambiguities are introduced here because they never made the marriage, you know, official official.

Because this looks really bad for Tyrion, obviously

Poor Tyrion just canâ€™t catch a break. Thereâ€™s just no way the imp would dare poison his nephew under such obvious circumstances â€“ and yet there he was, holding that fateful cup. Tyrion has gotten out of some tight spots, but justice is swift and rarely rational in Westeros. With Ceresi screeching accusations at her brother as the credits roll, his chances of survival look slim. Please, please, please letâ€™s not lose Tyrion over this one.

Because the Lannisters are sure to move down a few pegs

Full disclosure: Iâ€™m Team Lannister. Joffrey made that hard to admit, but the charming/clever Tyrion and his pragmatic father Tywin made up for it. Jaime Lannister â€“ his choice of mating partner notwithstanding â€“ has proven himself a character worth rooting for, especially now that heâ€™s on the comeback trail. But unless Ceresi thinks fast, the Lannisters' time of influence may be cut short. Not that they didnâ€™t have it coming. They did. Still, there was something deliciously sinister about their brief and brutal reign.

And whoâ€™s going to step up to the extreme cruelty plate?

Ramsay Snow torments Theon Greyjoy Credit: HBO.com

Game of Thrones plays to the worst angels of our nature; the sickening lack of humanity is practically the showâ€™s calling card. But no one was better at it than Joffrey, and someoneâ€™s going to have to take a step up to fill the horror void. Ramsay Snow, with his treatment of Theon Greyjoy (er, sorry, â€œReekâ€) has the malevolence, but the bastard son of Lord Roose Bolton doesnâ€™t yet have the influence to carry out the large-scale atrocities that Joffrey could. But his illegitimate father offers him a mission: Find Jon Snow, and â€œprove yourself a Boltonâ€ â€“ a chance to rise to prominence. Could G.R.R.M. be setting up the rise of the next sick bastard?

Because this â€˜Who Shot J.R.â€™ moment could drag on for weeks

Because honestly, he didnâ€™t suffer nearly enough

Break out the party hats, the king is dead!

Joffrey Baratheon, perhaps the most hated man-child in Westoros, croaked on Sunday's Game of Thrones, at his own wedding, no less.

The King, poisoned by an unknown hero of sorts, came as quite the shocker (what in this show isn't a shocker?), as he twitched into oblivion in Cersei Lannister's arms in just the second episode of the fourth season.

Fans dubbed the messy affair the Purple Wedding -- for the color of Joffrey's face -- as a callback to season 3's penultimate episode, the Red Wedding, where three Starks were killed at the behest of the Lannisters.

Karma, and marriage, in Westeros is no laughing matter.

We've gathered the best reactions to the demise of Joffrey, and his repulsive smirk, and theories on who may have been responsible for the choke heard 'round the world.

6869486,"We're Running Out of Time to Stop Global Warming, UN Says","The window of opportunity to avoid an amount of global warming that global leaders have agreed would be â€œdangerousâ€ is rapidly closing, with just a decade left for the world to begin undertaking sweeping technological and governmental actions to rein in emissions of global-warming gases such as carbon dioxide, according to a new United Nations report(Opens in a new window) released Sunday in Berlin. After that, it becomes far more difficult and expensive to cut emissions sufficiently to avoid dangerous amounts of warming.

Given recent emissions and temperature trends, the world is on track to see an increase in global average surface temperatures of up to 9 degrees Fahrenheit by the end of this century, the report says. This could have disastrous consequences by dramatically raising global sea levels, melting land-based ice sheets, and leading to more heat waves and extreme precipitation events, among other impacts.

SEE ALSO: 7 Key Findings From the New UN Climate Science Report

The report, the third and final installment of the latest comprehensive review of climate science from the Nobel Prize-winning UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Changeâ€™s (IPCC), analyzes more than 1,000 scenarios of potential economic growth and environmental changes to determine how to minimize global warming.

The report is simultaneously optimistic and grim in tone, since it concludes there is time and pre-existing technological knowledge available to meet the goals that leaders set out in a non-binding agreement(Opens in a new window) in 2009, yet lays bare the sheer scope of the challenges that lie ahead.

Pachauri, chairman of the IPCC and Jochen Schuette, State Secretary of the German Science Ministry, from left, pose for the media prior to a meeting of the UN IPCC in Berlin, Germany on April 7, 2014. Credit: Michael Sohn

The central task for scientists, engineers and policymakers is to figure out how to facilitate continued economic and population growth, without also causing emissions to skyrocket at the same time, the report says.

Figuring out how to do that gets at the core of global-development issues and the sharp climate-policy divide between industrialized and developing nations. Government representatives meeting in Berlin last week to approve the report, objected to language in the widely read summary for policymakers(Opens in a new window) that suggested developing countries have to do more to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, according to the New York Times(Opens in a new window). However, such language remained in the lengthy technical report. Text discussing transfers of funding to developing countries to assist them in growing their economies without boosting emissions was also removed from the summary,

The IPCCâ€™s fifth assessment provides the foundation for upcoming rounds of negotiations to craft a new global climate treaty, starting with a high-level climate summit in New York this September, and culminating in another summit in Paris next year. The next treaty is supposed to be enforced by 2020.

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said the report underscores the need for action by 2015.

â€œSo many of the technologies that will help us fight climate change are far cheaper, more readily available and better performing than they were when the last IPCC assessment was released less than a decade ago,â€ Kerry said in a statement. â€œThis report makes very clear we face an issue of global willpower, not capacity.â€

Here are some of the reportâ€™s key findings:

Weâ€™re not headed in the right direction, if we want to limit global warming: Total manmade greenhouse-gas emissions were the highest in human history from 2000 to 2010, and reached 49 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent per year in 2010. The vast majority of that, or about 78%, has come from burning fossil fuels for energy, with smaller amounts coming from deforestation, agriculture and other sources.

Business as usual is not climate as usual: Atmospheric carbon-dioxide levels are currently just above 400 parts per million (ppm), and are already the highest in at least the past 800,000 years. Under a business as usual scenario, the report says carbon can be expected to soar to higher than 1,300 ppm by 2100. This could lead to global warming ranging from 4.5 degrees Fahrenheit to 14 degrees Fahrenheit above pre-industrial levels by the end of this century, when the full range of scientific uncertainty is taken into account.

At the right side of the figure, greenhouse-gas emissions in 2010 are shown again broken down into these components with the associated uncertainties (90% confidence interval) indicated by the error bars. Credit: UN IPCC

The last 40 years have brought a carbon boom the likes of which weâ€™ve never experienced before: About half of all cumulative manmade carbon-dioxide emissions between 1750 and 2010 occurred during the past 40 years. Since carbon dioxide remains in the atmosphere for hundreds to more than 1,000 years, the cumulative emissions are what determines how much warming weâ€™re ultimately in store for, and weâ€™ve already burned about half of the carbon budget that would keep warming to less than 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit. That was the target world leaders agreed to in 2009 during a contentious round of UN climate talks.

Donâ€™t place all the blame on population growth: The biggest factors contributing to the recent spike in greenhouse-gas emissions are economic and population growth, with economic growth playing the largest role in the last decade. The report singles out the increased use of coal for electricity as the reason why the decarbonization of energy production has essentially halted.

Emissions would have to be slashed ASAP to meet the 3.6 degree Fahrenheit target: To have a good chance of limiting warming to less than 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit compared to pre-industrial levels, carbon-dioxide levels would have to be kept below 450 ppm by 2100. This would require emissions cuts of 40% to 70% by 2050, and near or below zero emissions by 2100. Accomplishing this without paying an exorbitant cost would require that actions begin within the next decade.

Yes, that does say â€œnear or below zero by 2100â€: To keep emissions low enough to avert the worst potential consequences of manmade global warming, emissions donâ€™t just have to come down, they have to hit the floor and keep on going, the IPCC says.

The longer we wait to enact emissions cuts, the worse climate change will be, and the more expensive it will be: Waiting until 2030 to start reducing emissions would eliminate many of the more than 1,000 policy scenarios examined in this report, and increase the costs of cutting emissions, as well as the costs of climate impacts. Part of the reason for this is that investments made today in power plants and buildings will lock in place particular levels of carbon emissions for up to a half-century, since such structures last a long time.

â€œA decision to put up a building is a multidecadal decision,â€ Chris Pyke, one of the report's authors, told Mashable. â€œWeâ€™re locking in choices, and weâ€™re locking out the ability to do something else.â€

Renewable energy sources need to grow -- and fast: Most of the scenarios that involve relatively modest amounts of global warming include a rapid ramp-up of renewable-energy sources, to where they contribute about 80% of the global electricity supply by 2050. Renewable-energy technologies accounted for just over half of the new electricity-generating capacity added worldwide in 2012.

Natural gas can be part of the solution: Replacing coal-fired power plants with natural-gas plants can reduce greenhouse-gas emissions, as long as high amounts of emissions do not occur when drilling for and transporting gas supplies.

Efficiency is also key: Huge reductions in greenhouse gas emissions can be made in the buildings sector, since we already have the technology to make buildings more efficient. For example, 70% of New York Cityâ€™s emissions come from the buildings sector, according to Pyke.",4/13/2014 0:00,0.639456,2,5,0,4.182432,8,00000,3265.301,8393.296,5491.124,9000,0.720513,0.026923,0.040541,0.033784,0,0,1000
7006073,Another Google Glass Wearer Attacked in San Francisco,"The perils of wearing Google Glass became apparent yet again when a man wearing the device was attacked on the streets of San Francisco on Friday.

Kyle Russell, a 20-year-old journalist, was wrapping up a day of covering the local Google protests and on his way to the 16th Street BART train station when a woman yelled out ""Glass!"" and snatched the device off his face.

[seealso slug=""when-google-glass-haters-attack""]

Russell and his friend gave chase, the trio running in and out of traffic, but the woman ultimately got away, smashing the device on the ground before making her escape.

""The tone of how she yelled 'Glass!' and the way she smashed Glass gave me the impression that its destruction was her intention,"" Russell told Mashable when asked if he thought the woman only intended to steal the device rather than just break it. ""But my interpretation could be skewed by my place in the incident.""

Just had Glass torn off my face and smashed on the ground in the Missionâ€” Kyle Russell (@kylebrussell) April 12, 2014(Opens in a new window)

However, for those who might draw connections between Friday's Google protesters and the would-be Glass thief, Russell himself doesn't seem to think she was connected with the protest group.

Describing the woman as in her early 20s, Russell says the woman had a faux-hawk with the sides of her head shaved and wore a black leather jacket and boots. ""That's not really how I'd describe anyone in the crowd at the protest I was at earlier that day, and she was walking from the opposite direction of the protestors' march,"" says Russell.

Testing the $1,500 device after the incident, Russell said it now offers ""no response to voice or touch,"" and is basically ""unusable.""

This latest anecdote could just be a random mugging attempt, or it may be yet another signal highlighting the growing tensions between San Francisco's tech haves and have-nots.

""I'm not an SF resident,"" says Russell. ""I live in Berkeley and work in San Francisco. With that said, I do think that Google Glass, Google buses, and gentrification have all come to be associated in the minds of many residents in the city. There's a reason the protestors on Friday were carrying signs that said 'Tech = Death' and asking Google to step in.""

Imagine if other famous television shows took place in the Mad Men universe.

7025907,Investigators Suspect MH370's Black-Box Batteries Have Died: Report,"The multinational flotilla scouring the seas to the west of Perth, Australia for signs of the missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 have not heard any electronic pings from the plane's cockpit voice or data recorders since April 8, suggesting the batteries on these devices may have run out, according to a new report(Opens in a new window).

Manufactured by Honeywell, battery-operated acoustic beacons attached to the black boxes were designed to send out electronic signals for about 30 days after entering the water. As of Sunday, it has now been 37 days since Flight 370, a Boeing 777-200, went missing during a late-night flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on March 8.

The battery life of these devices can last longer than 30 days, but the signals may become more faint and intermittent as the battery dies out, making it more difficult for investigators to find them, according to Honeywell. The beacons are about 4 inches wide and resemble â€œa roll of silver dollarsâ€ bolted to the recorders, Steven Brecken, a Honeywell spokesperson, told Mashable.

Investigators have been using specially designed sensors to detect the telltale pings from the black boxes in the deep waters of the southern Indian Ocean. The Ocean Shield, an Australian ship, has been dragging a U.S. Navy sensor, which had previously detected multiple signals that matched the black-box sounds. That ship has not heard any such indications since Tuesday, the AP reported.

The beacons are designed to send out one signal per second at a frequency of about 37.5 kHz, which can be distinguished from other marine sounds, such as whales. Investigators have said that pings picked up by the search team have been ""consistent with"" the black-box transmissions.

""We're now into Day 37 of this tragedy,"" aviation expert Geoffrey Thomas told the AP. ""The battery life on the beacons is supposed to last 30 days. We're hoping it might last 40 days. However, it's been four or five days since the last strong pings. What they're hoping for is to get one more, maybe two more pings so they can do a triangulation of the sounds and try and narrow the [search] area.""

Once investigators determine that it is highly unlikely that any further sounds from the black boxes will be detected, they will have to resort to exploring the sea floor several miles down for signs of any wreckage -- a laborious process that could take anywhere from months to several years, depending on the size of the search zone. The black-box pings have been the best chance for investigators to narrow the search area, given the lack of radar data pinpointing the plane's location at the time it disappeared.

The current underwater search zone measures 500 square miles, which is about the size of Los Angeles, according to the AP. The submersible that will be used to investigate the seafloor, known as Bluefin 21(Opens in a new window) and manufactured by Bluefin Robotics of Massachusetts, has a maximum depth of 15,000 feet, which is about the same depth as in the search area.",4/13/2014 0:00,0.524306,20,1,0,5.284983,6,00000,1300.485,3599.783,2142.541,3400,0.305952,-0.0873,0.011945,0.017065,0,0,1300

Why Heartbleed Is the Ultimate Web Nightmare | Mashable

Overnight, Heartbleed became the word on everyone's tongues -- not just techies. And it's understandable why: The bug has the potential to be one of the biggest, most widespread vulnerabilities in the history of the modern web. It's easy to want to think the reaction is overblown, but sadly, it's not; Heartbleed is bad. Really bad. Here, Mashable's Christina Warren explains why it's such a big deal -- and why you need to change your passwords (if you haven't already). Right now.

7025937,White House to Allow NSA to Exploit Some Internet Security Flaws,"The White House has weighed in on the Heartbleed bug and its reported exploitation by the NSA.

In a New York Times(Opens in a new window) report on Saturday, senior administration officials said that President Obama has decided that when the NSA discovers major flaws in Internet security, it should reveal them to the general public to insure that they will be fixed, but not in the event of ""a clear national security or law enforcement need"" -- a loophole that will likely allow the NSA to continue to exploit security flaws.

This news comes after anonymous sources told Bloomberg that the NSA knew about the Heartbleed bug that exposed a major vulnerability in security protocols used by many popular websites like Google and Facebook, and used it to gather intelligence for at least two years. The White House and the NSA have since denied that report.

The White House has never publicly announced what President Obama's decision in a three-month review of recommendations by a presidential advisory committee to reform the NSA in January entailed. But the nature of the White House's position on the matter has become more evident after the Heartbleed bug became a global issue and after the administration denied having any prior knowledge about the security bug on Friday.

The White House statement issued to the Times stated that when major Internet security flaws are discovered, a ""bias"" exists in the government that would favor sharing knowledge of the flaw with computer and software manufacturers to create a solution, fix the problem and distribute said fix. But before such a decision, the government would assess whether or not it is ""a clear national security or law enforcement need"" -- a broad and key distinction that could be open to an assortment of interpretations.

Caitlyn Hayden, the spokeswoman for the National Security Council, said that the new ""reinvigorated"" process, determined from those reviews in January, will weigh the value of disclosing a discovered security flaw against keeping it secret so the intelligence community can later use it.

However, Hayden noted that the process is ""biased toward responsibly disclosing such vulnerabilities"" as opposed to withholding the information.",4/13/2014 0:00,0.694268,4,0,0,4.358491,5,00000,1092.976,5992.792,4369.503,18600,0.510561,0.147727,0.081761,0.031447,0.416667,0.375,876
7025883,3 Techniques for Acing a Phone Interview,"Increasingly, employers are phone-screening job candidates before inviting them for an on-site interview.

Maybe this is good news. Phone interviews are easier, right? You can have a bunch of cheat sheets in front of you -- your resume, sample answers to common interview questions(Opens in a new window), and key facts about the company. You can wear your pajamas -- heck, you can even stay in bed while you chat!

Well, not exactly. In fact, the number one mistake job candidates make on phone interviews is sounding tired, bored, or disengaged. Good luck avoiding this if youâ€™re reading from a script or tucked away in bed!

Without visual cues, interviewers are paying extra close attention to the content of your answers and anything else they can glean from your voice. So, lackluster answers or low energy could be read as lack of interest -- and can keep you from getting in the door for that next interview.

So, how can you maximize what you convey with your voice? Follow these simple steps.

1. Do Some Power Poses

A few minutes before the interview, prep by doing some â€œpower poses(Opens in a new window).â€ Research shows that standing with your legs shoulder-length apart with your hands on your hips and your chest out for just two minutes raises your testosterone levels, lowers cortisol, and makes you sound more confident. You might feel silly, but at the very least, itâ€™ll help calm some nerves. Definitely a good thing!

2. Stand Like a Speaker

Like anyone whoâ€™s speaking or telling a story(Opens in a new window), you want to sound dynamic and engaged. And slouching in a chair is just not going to help with this. Instead, try positioning yourself like a speaker: A good setup is having some relevant materials on a desk or table in front of you as you stand. (And by relevant, I mean bulleted talking points, not prepared documents -- remember, you want to sound natural and energetic!)

3. Donâ€™t Forget to Smile

And feel free to laugh! Yes, this is an interview for a job, but ideally itâ€™s also a conversation between two mutually interested parties. Donâ€™t make the mistake of sounding overly serious or timid. Your skills and qualifications got you the interview, but itâ€™s your personality and commitment that wins over hiring managers. The fact is, no matter how standardized companies try to make their interview processes, being friendly and getting the interviewer excited about working with you(Opens in a new window) will have a huge effect on whether you get invited to the on-site interview. So, smile! Even if they canâ€™t see it, your voice will sound more cheerful.",4/13/2014 0:00,0.460637,22,10,0,4.433498,10,Lifestyle,2992.663,41700,8251.765,2500,0.609201,0.259013,0.065681,0.018062,1,0.8,1400
7005834,How to Stand Up for Yourself at Work and Get What You Need,"When my client Margaret called me, she was in a state of total frustration.

She was a hard working, positive-minded, letâ€™s-get-it-done kind of employee, and had never had performance issues(Opens in a new window) in her career. But after long-term success in a job she loved, sheâ€™d just been assigned a new manager who was unlike any other: He gave her the silent treatment, iced her out of conversations, and, overall, was a bit of a bully.

As a result, Margaret, a positively positive and highly effective employee, had turned into a rattled bunch of nerves. She dreaded every interaction with this manager, fearing that in sheer frustration, sheâ€™d eventually blurt out â€œI quit!â€(Opens in a new window) without having any kind of backup plan. She wanted to make it work -- it was a great job with a wonderful community of colleagues -- but she had no idea how she could.

Perhaps, like Margaret, youâ€™ve thought that if you put your nose to the grindstone, do good work, and have a can-do attitude, your career will be smooth sailing. The problem is, many other factors have an impact on your career, too -- including the people around you and your relationships with them. And when those people turn into stonewall managers and abrasive colleagues(Opens in a new window), youâ€™ll need more than a good work ethic and positive attitude to effectively deal with them.

In short, I told Margaret, â€œYou canâ€™t â€˜positive thinkâ€™ your way out of this situation. You need something more.â€

Thatâ€™s why I encourage all professionals to develop one extremely important skill as early in their careers as possible: self-advocacy. This ability to assert what you need (even if that means having difficult and potentially awkward conversations(Opens in a new window)) can be rewarding and confidence-building -- and it plays a major part in ensuring that you get what you need to move your career forward.

But, as you can probably guess, itâ€™s not always easy. Read on to learn why this skill is so beneficial and some ways to start developing it in your own career.

Why you must learn to advocate for yourself

Margaretâ€™s manager probably didnâ€™t know how miserable she was -- because she never brought it up. You see, managers and other authority figures will generally presume everything is OK unless you let them know otherwise. For others to become aware that their behavior is unacceptable(Opens in a new window) or that your needs arenâ€™t being met, you need to tell them. Otherwise, you simply reinforce their behavior.

When you embrace the practice of having these difficult conversations, youâ€™ll be able to open up about what you need. Instead of backing off in fear, youâ€™ll learn to handle tough problems while treating people with dignity and respect.

Why it's so hard

No matter how long youâ€™ve been in the professional world, youâ€™ve probably seen ample opportunities for difficult conversations. The overbearing boss. The colleague who never meets a deadline. The client who insists on getting more than what was agreed upon in the contract. As much as youâ€™d love to gloss over those issues(Opens in a new window), you know itâ€™s in the best interest of your career to advocate for yourself and confront the situation head-on.

At the same time, no one relishes the idea of having a difficult conversation; you worry about what youâ€™re going to say, how youâ€™ll be perceived, and what the final outcome of the confrontation will be. In short, somethingâ€™s at risk, opinions vary, and emotions are a big factor.

If thatâ€™s not enough, Roy Lubit, MD, PhD, a forensic psychiatrist based in New York, observes(Opens in a new window), â€œSomehow, we are supposed to be experts on dealing with other people and with our own emotions even though these issues were never formally addressed in our education and training.â€

Think about it: When do we ever really learn the complex nuances of having difficult conversations and dealing with delicate situations in the workplace? (Hint: Usually, we donâ€™t.)

How to start

The good news is, with some simple steps and practice, you can get much more comfortable with the idea of speaking up for yourself. Here are the basic steps I taught Margaret about having a conversation with her manager, and how you can apply them to your situation, as well:

Remember that advocating for yourself means being assertive, not aggressive. You can start the process by calling a meeting with the person in question. In Margaretâ€™s case, she made a simple request to her boss: â€œTanner, Iâ€™d like to get some time on your calendar to discuss how weâ€™re working together. What would be a good time for you?â€ When youâ€™re sharing what you need in a difficult conversation, stay calm, focused, and unemotional(Opens in a new window) throughout the meeting. Youâ€™ll want to focus the conversation on what you need, rather than casting blame or criticizing others.

To start, identify the facts and impact of the situation and summarize them in a few succinct statements. For example, â€œIâ€™m not always made aware of decisions or commitments made in staff meetings. Since I need that information to design solutions for my customers, that puts me at risk of not meeting customer needsâ€”and an adverse rating from customers could really hurt the department.â€

Then, identify specifically what you need to happen to address that situation: â€œI really need the information about programs and pricing thatâ€™s covered in the staff meetings.â€ (If there are multiple issues, prioritize a list of the most important, and start at the top.)

To ensure that your requests are understood, finish the conversation with questions like, â€œBased on the current situation and what we need to do to be successful, what can we do to make this happen?â€ This will engage the other party and help problem solve, rather than block conversation with objections(Opens in a new window).

If you try these basics and find that nothing has changed, itâ€™s worth checking to see if your HR or training team offers courses focused on navigating difficult conversations. If not, check out online or local community college courses that can get you on the right track.",4/13/2014 0:00,0.564748,5,1,3,3.754386,5,Entertainment,3265.301,17800,6607.697,2166.667,0.457576,0.005682,0.011696,0.008772,0.5,0.318182,5800

Name: Tidy(Opens in a new window)

One-Liner Pitch: Tidy Photo is a mix between functionality of Mailbox and nostalgia of Timehop.

Why It's Taking Off: Smartphone photo albums are exploding and users need a better way to sort and thus enjoy their photos.

The camera in your smartphone is one of its best features, but the photos are catching up with us. If you have photos by the thousands of everything from last month's vacation to a picture of your home Wi-Fi password, you might appreciate Tidy Photo app, which aims to help you sort the trove.

[seealso slug=""cliche-instagram-photos""]

The app sorts the photos on your smartphone by distance, time or shape (i.e., panorama) -- so my pictures from a recent vacation in San Francisco naturally grouped together, along with photos I'd taken at a wedding in the region a year prior. Similarly, all the photos taken near or at work are grouped together, and the group of photos taken near my family's home are all from trips to visit. Once grouped, you can then decide if those photos merit their own album and swipe right to create it, making some order out of the chronological mess. You can also archive photos by swiping left.

It's a step in the right direction for a growing problem. Personally, I use an app called CameraSync to mass upload my iPhone photos to Flickr, which allows me to delete them off my phone, but they're still not sorted. Tidy could make sorting as habitual as snapping photos, which will pay of in the long term.

Your default photo app will not be affected but Tidy plans to eventually sync the now-sorted photos across devices and also allow you to upload full albums to Facebook, Flickr or Google+ or other social sites (right now you can add a group of photos to Facebook or individual photos to Instagram or Twitter, but you'd have to regroup photos into a Facebook album).

Tidy launched in November 2013 for iOS and January 2014 for Android. The app has more than 600,000 users, primarily in China, South Korea (where the company is based) and Thailand but the app is starting to catch on in the US and Europe.

""People now are having joy of instant photo sharing, but donâ€™t have a right way to enjoy thousands photos,"" says Kwangbae Lee, product manager. ""Our goal is giving them the pleasure of enjoying curated photos. I think this explains how we approach to our product and users.""

Another photo app that enables better photo sorting is Yoovi(Opens in a new window), which is targeted towards parents and enables families to create private photo albums and invite family and friends to view via their phone's contact list. Dropbox also recently released a photo app of its own called Carousel(Opens in a new window).

""The National Security and Defense Council has decided to launch a full-scale anti-terrorist operation involving the armed forces of Ukraine,"" Turchinov said. ""We will not allow Russia to repeat the Crimean scenario in the eastern regions of Ukraine.""

The takeover of Ukraine government buildings turned bloody Sunday, as government forces sought to retake a building seized by pro-Russian militants in the eastern city of Sloviansk.

Ukraine Interior Minister Arsen Avakov said one government security officer was killed and four were wounded in what he termed an ""anti-terrorist"" operation(Opens in a new window). ""There were dead and wounded on both sides,"" Avakov said, according to Reuters.

The Russian news agency RIA reported that one pro-Moscow activist(Opens in a new window) was killed in the clashes in Sloviansk.

Sloviansk was one of at least five cities where armed pro-Russian separatists had taken over Ukraine government buildings and erected barricades in recent hours. Many of them wore camouflaged uniforms, and carried Kalashnikov rifles identical to those worn and carried by the pro-Russian forces who took control of Crimea a month ago.

Officials in Kiev and Washington said the moves appeared to be orchestrated by Russia, much like how Moscow moved against Crimea.

â€œWe are very concerned by the concerted campaign we see underway in eastern Ukraine today by pro-Russian separatists, apparently with support from Russia, who are inciting violence and sabotage and seeking to undermine and destabilize the Ukrainian state,â€ Laura Lucas Magnuson, a National Security Council spokesperson, said in a statement.(Opens in a new window) â€œWe saw similar so-called protest activities in Crimea before Russiaâ€™s purported annexation.

The folks at Movoto(Opens in a new window) wanted to test common theories about geographic illiteracy against real-time results. Challenging several hundred people to hover over states on their computer screens, the researchers gave each participant five seconds to correctly identify and locate a given U.S. state on a map, while tracking their answers in real time.

The results, unfortunately, are probably what you'd expect (cue the womp womp).

Although an overwhelming majority of quiz-takers correctly identified the biggest states -- looking at you California, Florida and Texas -- much of middle America and the Northeast saw less-than-stellar answers.

Many participants mixed up Pennsylvania, New York, Vermont and New Hampshire, as well as the four corner states of Utah, Colorado, Arizona and New Mexico. Even worse results came when the quiz prompted users to find Missouri, and the cursors scattered randomly over the bible belt. What did Missouri do to warrant such a complete lack of recognition? Let's be better for Missouri.

7025830,Real-Time 3D Images Coming to a Blood Vessel Near You,"Your doctor will now have access to detailed information about you â€“â€“ at least of your blood vessels, arteries and heart that is.

Researchers from the Georgia Institute of Technology created a device that will allow doctors to capture real-time 3D images from inside the heart, coronary arteries and blood vessels. The microchip device is less invasive than other medical tools, catheter-based and small enough to operate in blood.

Only 1.5mm in diameter, the device uses ultrasound imaging techniques to capture images at 60 frames per second â€“â€“ though the breakthrough component is its ability to take forward-facing images. Current imaging technology can only capture a cross section view and can hinder a surgery's success.

â€œOur device will allow doctors to see the whole volume that is in front of them within a blood vessel,â€ said F. Levent Degertekin, a professor in the George W. Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology to the Georgia Tech News Center(Opens in a new window). â€œThis will give cardiologists the equivalent of a flashlight so they can see blockages ahead of them in occluded arteries. It has the potential for reducing the amount of surgery that must be done to clear these vessels.â€

Similarly, its use of catheters â€“â€“ medical devices usually used for drainage, insertion of fluids and more â€“â€“ means a doctor can get a closer look at a patient's inside without using invasive surgery techniques.

Requiring little energy, the device generates less heat within the body, which means less possible damage to the blood of the patient.

Currently, the research team aims to start animal studies soon to see the true potential of their prototype device when its used on humans. While the device is currently intended to be used for cardiac surgery, Degertekin told Wired(Opens in a new window), he isnâ€™t opposed to the idea of using it on a broken bone to give doctors real-time information on when a cast could be removed.

The Hollywood Reporter(Opens in a new window) on Monday reported that Fincher's demands for a $10 million upfront fee and creative control has the studio looking to replace the director. But as he was never technically on the movie, neither is he technically off it, either.

SEE ALSO: Christian Bale to Play Steve Jobs? David Fincher Has His Heart Set on It

A person with knowledge of the negotiations tells Mashable that Fincher never actually signed a deal to direct Aaron Sorkin's script about the late Apple founder, and that the Girl With the Dragon Tattoo director may still be in the mix for the job.

The uncertainty also casts doubt on whether Christian Bale will wind up playing Jobs. Earlier reports had Bale as the prohibitive favorite to take the role, as he was Fincher's first -- and only -- choice. In fact, Fincher told Sony brass during early negotiations that he'd only do the movie if Bale is onboard.

Fincher has some history of fraught relations with Sony executives, as Dragon Tatoo was widely known as a difficult project. But there's good reason for Fincher and the studio to resolve their differences, which would reunite most of the creative team behind The Social Network -- and remember that that Sony film all but went the distance in the Oscar race, narrowly losing the 2011 Oscar to The King's Speech.",4/14/2014 0:00,0.288627,34,11,0,4.541636,7,Business,2458.74,5050.029,3409.231,2481.818,0.47962,0.203668,0.057781,0.013838,0.6,0.2,2600

Disney's acquisition of Maker Studios, the YouTube-centric production company, is getting messy, according to various reports.

Relativity Media, a mid-size film and television production and distribution company, has offered Maker a counterbid of $500 million in stock, with a bonus of another $400 million in stock conditional on achieving certain financial targets, according to The Wall Street Journal(Opens in a new window).

[seealso slug=http://mashable.com/2014/03/25/disney-places-a-bet-on-mobile-and-youtube-with-maker-acquisition/]

In addition to that $900 million, the deal is said to include a $100 million bonus pool for talent and executives.

""Relativity's proposal fully values Maker Studios while providing its shareholders far more upside potential for growth than the Disney offer,"" Maker said in a statement Sunday, according to the publication.

That would narrowly edged Disney's offer of $500 million in cash with $450 million available if Disney's financial targets are met.

In addition to the counterbid, Disney's acquisition has also been complicated by a lawsuit from Danny Zappin(Opens in a new window), co-founder and ex-CEO of Maker, and three other former executives. They are seeking to block the deal.

The lawsuit follows on earlier legal action from Zappin(Opens in a new window) and the former executives over his exit from the company.

The counter from Relativity highlights the growing interest from traditional media in studios that have begun to find success producing short-form content for sites like YouTube. Maker recently licensed content from Bart Barker, one of its breakout talents, with television channel Music Choice.

The counteroffer has a ways to go to beat out Disney. Maker's board would need to decide if the offer from Relativity was tempting, which it could very well not be since Disney's offer includes a significant chunk of cash.

Disney's previous deal with Maker could also thwart Relativity's offer. A source indicated to the Journal that its agreement with Maker is binding.",4/14/2014 0:00,0.46506,6,1,0,4.360382,8,00000,1310.227,4900,3399.373,0,0.410831,0.139347,0.036993,0.01074,0.27,0.08,705

7005786,My Escape From Eastern Ukraine,"SLOVIANSK, Ukraine â€” As you drive into the outskirts of Sloviansk, a small town of just around 130,000 deep in eastern Ukraine, it becomes clear that the countryâ€™s crisis is reaching new levels.

I have spent the last week traveling across the region with another British journalist, and on Saturday, as we approach the city, the first thing we see is a checkpoint manned by pro-Russia militia mingling with police blocking the road. A bus filled with men dressed in combat fatigues is parked on a grass verge nearby. It is clear that these people are now in control of who enters or leaves the city.

Further down the road we hit another checkpoint, where a group of men flag us down demanding to know what why we are coming to Sloviansk.

As we talk, I notice a Russian flag that has been erected on a road sign and ask to take a picture of it. A couple of the men, eager to show it in the best light, climb up the sign to straighten it; there is pride in Russia here. I ask about the police at the first checkpoint. ""The police are with us,"" says the groupâ€™s leader, a middle-aged man dressed in combat gear with a peaked cap. ""They are the people, too."" He starts laughing: ""Do you like our bus?"" he says and points up the road.

I've become familiar with the increasing lawlessness of the region, having already visited the cities of Luhansk and Donetsk, where pro-Russia separatists have stormed and occupied government buildings, demanding the right to hold referendums that would allow them to join the Russian Federation. East Ukraine is close to the Russian border, and Russian is almost universally spoken here. Moscowâ€™s influence permeates everything -- from the architecture to the food.

Ukraine has staggered from one crisis to another since the Euromaidan revolution that deposed President Viktor Yanukovych in February.

Yanukovych â€“- a Donetsk man seen as a Kremlin puppet by the Euromaidan activists -- was more popular in the East where the revolution is reviled among many with pro-Russia leanings. The people here told me repeatedly that the Kiev government treats them with contempt and wants to eradicate the speaking of Russian in Ukraine. Anger and paranoia combined with grinding economic depression is everywhere. Violence was inevitable.

Russian President Vladimir Putin annexed the Ukrainian region of Crimea two months ago and the Ukrainian government, not without good reason, fears further Russian incursions onto its territory -- or at the very least Russian meddling. Moscow has proven adept at stirring unrest amongst Ukraineâ€™s pro-Russian population in Crimea and the many protests I have seen in the area contain organized elements that suggest more than merely a simultaneous outpouring of disaffection.

Sloviansk is a bleak, industrial city of concrete buildings and grey streets that are broken up by threadbare patches of grass. Only few people are out, walking hunched over in the falling rain. The occupied police station is in the city centre and we manage to tag onto a group of protesters passing through the makeshift barricades that surround it, and go inside.

Inside, more barricades line the streets; Russian flags fly everywhere. The Donbass Region and Russian Empire flags are also in evidence. A crowd of about a thousand is in full voice. The same chants that I have heard again and again over the last week echo through the streets. ""Ro-Si-Ya! Ro-Si-Ya!"" alternates with ""Re-Fer-En-Dum! Re-Fer-En-Dum!""

Masked men armed with large machine guns and in full military dress stalk the area around the police station. Their uniforms are unmarked but they are clearly professional soldiers and are obviously in charge here. Many bark orders to the gangs of youths building up the barricades. The Ukrainian government has vowed to take the occupied buildings in Eastern Ukraine and the people here are preparing for war.

Speakers are whipping the crowd into further excitement and its roars grow louder. The people we speak to all reiterate their desire for a referendum and their contempt for the government and for the Euromaidan revolution, but it is clear nothing more is happening so we make our way out. After a meal in a local restaurant my friend tries to get back inside but is refused. ""Itâ€™s for your own safety,"" a guard tells him. ""The boys get a bit rowdy at night.""

Sunday morning things are calm but tense. Everyone now expects the imminent arrival of troops from Kiev and the area around the barricades is thronged with armed men conferring amongst themselves and shouting to each other across the streets.

Whole city of #Sloviansk(Opens in a new window) is just waiting for conflict #Ukraine(Opens in a new window)â€” David Patrikarakos (@dpatrikarakos) April 13, 2014(Opens in a new window)

Reports are coming in that government forces have arrived but no one seems to know anything. The barricades are built up even more. The afternoon brings sporadic gunfire sounds around the city -- and it's clear that conflict has arrived in Sloviansk.

But I have more pressing problems. For various reasons I have had to part from my Russian-speaking friend and am now alone in the city and unable to speak the language, which under the present conditions is less than ideal. No trains are running, and a taxi carrying a foreign man will never make it through the many checkpoints around the city.

The only thing I can think is to call to my brother in the U.S. His girlfriend is American-Ukrainian and her father lived and worked in Ukraine for years where he had dealings with the military. The message quickly comes back that he can arrange to get me out. I tell him I donâ€™t have much money and he says not to worry â€“- the people who will do it are his friends. He tells me to sit tight and wait, which I do. A couple of hours later I get a phone call from ""Andriy."" He is, he explains, a major in the Ukrainian army in Kiev. He will get me out, he says, but it will have to be done covertly. If Ukrainian army soldiers are discovered here they will be taken captive, or worse, killed. The message is the same: ""Sit tight,"" he tells me. ""I am sending men to get you. Give me your address.""

Half an hour later there is a knock at my door and three men, dressed in the Ukrainian working class style â€“ thick jumpers, jeans and leather jackets are standing outside. They tell me to pack quickly. The plan, Andriy tells me on another call, is that the men will take me past the inner city checkpoints, at which point, we will switch cars and a different set of people will get through the far more dangerous checkpoints that control access in and out of Sloviansk.

As we leave the Hotel Ukraine where I have been staying, just streets from the occupied police station, I ask ""Anatoly,"" the guy who speaks the best English of the three, what the plan is. ""Now we drink Cognac,"" is his surreal answer. ""Iâ€™m sorry?"" I reply. Sure enough, we immediately cross the street to buy a bottle of Cognac before congregating around a nearby park bench to drink it and, rather incongruously it seems to me (though itâ€™s a custom out here), eat chocolate. In the distance I hear machine gun fire.

I take this opportunity to ask Anatoly where our car is. ""We get taxi,"" he replies. While I digest this further piece of alarming information I ask Anatoly where he is from and rather surprisingly he tells me that he is from Kramatorsk (a nearby town). But, he continues with a wink, ""I have spent some time in Kiev.""

We walk through the city streets onto a main road where several ancient Lada taxis are parked up on the pavement. Anatoly begins gesticulating and talking loudly to one of the drivers, sweating and raging while he tries to convince him to take us through the city checkpoints and, unbelievably, haggles over the price. Anatoly can tell I am getting frustrated. ""Donâ€™t worry, be happy!"" he says, before laughing hysterically at his own joke.

Agreement is reached with the taxi driver and the four of us pile into the beaten up car and drive through Sloviansk, negotiating the barricades that span the road at various points throughout the city centre. We reach the main city checkpoint and Anatoly gets out to talk to the armed militia manning it. They are soon laughing at his jokes and for the first time Iâ€™m grateful for his bluff, good nature. Once through the checkpoint Iâ€™m told that itâ€™s time to get out and walk to the meet point where they will hand me over to the next car. ""Itâ€™s women who are coming,"" says Anatoly. ""Four men in a car is not good. Only women can get you past those checkpoints.""

Anatoly is in good spirits as we wait for the car on the corner of a junction where several militia have gathered, clutching bats and sticks. ""See him,"" he says pointing to one of his friends, ""He is gay!"" before collapsing with laughter once more. ""No, that was joke,"" he continues. Anatoly wants to drink more Cognac but I tell him that now is not the time. He looks crestfallen.

After about fifteen minutes a black car with two blonde women in it pulls up. I say goodbye to Anatoly and the others and we set off. As we approach the first checkpoint the women smile and wave at the armed guards, who usher us through with barely a second glance. At every checkpoint I have previously crossed in Eastern Ukraine I have been stopped and interrogated. The phone rings and the driver passes me the phone. ""My name is Colonel Valeri Dobogyrsky, of the Ukrainian army in Kiev city,"" says the voice at the other end. ""These women are my officers. Everything will be fine."" We pass through another two checkpoints with similar ease and I am on the road to Donetsk airport and to safety.

Back in Kiev itâ€™s another world.

Elegant Ukrainian girls walk past designer shops while cafes blare out Jessie J. But the talk of war is everywhere. In Maidan Square in the city centre, the scene of the revolution that ousted Yanukovych, the pro-Ukrainian militia are still camped out in tents.

Many of them believe they will soon be fighting again.

The one-minute clip shows Hazel (Woodley) and Gus (Elgort) mingling outside of a youth support group for kids with cancer. Things start off pleasantly, until Gus pulls out a cigarette, but to Hazel's surprise, it's more about philosophy than smoking.

Woodley and Elgort are currently owning the YA space, also co-starring as siblings in the Divergent series.

Working small, thinking big... I think a lot of people are drawn to startups because they are smaller, more intimate companies where you get to know the people around you. For example, I went to Olin College, which only has 300 students. Recreating the small-team interactions I had at college were part of the reason a small company appealed to me. Pocket Gems was smaller than my previous company, but they had a strong focus on software engineering. I knew that Pocket Gems' engineering focus meant that, even with fewer people, the group would be more my style.

Gaming is sexy... Before joining Pocket Gems, I was working at the space technology company, Blue Origin. Developing space technology was an amazing opportunity for an amateur space geek and was great for my inner child. Pocket Gems still managed to pull me in because, letâ€™s face it, games are sexy. I saw Pocket Gems as an opportunity to make games that would touch millions of people. Pocket Gems was also a place where I could grow and learn as a software engineer in ways I couldnâ€™t yet imagine.I started at Pocket Gems in January 2012 as the first Android engineer. When I started, I was mainly writing Java. Today, I'm the lead engineer on the Android Platform, coordinating across multiple engineering teams.

Horsing around... In the two plus years since I've been at Pocket Gems, it's gotten bigger, but you wouldn't know it from the way the office acts. Youâ€™ll still find people playing pool or ping pong after lunch. People can still be caught aiming a Nerf gun at the window while waiting for code to compile or for Excel to get itâ€™s act together. But the company is also older and wiser; weâ€™ve learned a lot about what goes into hit games and what doesnâ€™t. We have better tools and more options for designers and engineers alike. We now spend more time investing in our teamâ€™s growth, ensuring both the company and its individuals are always evolving.

Constant challenges... Pocket Gems is never stale. I don't think anyone here is still doing the exact same job they were when they first walked in the door. If you want to learn and grow, Pocket Gems has plenty of ways to help you do that. I've worked on the Android versions of over a dozen different games in two years and each project has itâ€™s own life. Whether itâ€™s a hit game or not, it's always interesting. All projects are all different. Some are easy. Some are exciting. Most are challenging.

Team pride... My favorite projects have had challenging engineering dragons that could take a week to slay. Every launch is another trophy, the final result of months of challenges and successes. Every launch is a reminder of the experiences our scrappy Android team has had together.

Today, Pocket Gems has 175 employees.

My first job... I was in college when I received my offer from Coyote, so I had never had a â€œreal worldâ€ job. But I was so excited about Coyote because of the opportunity to learn about the logistics industry and be a part of a company that had huge aspirations to become an industry giant! I loved that intensity and wanted to be a part of it.

A winding path... Working at a small company was a great way to dive into my career, and my career path at Coyote has evolved. This is a huge perk of starting at a company when it is very young and growing really fast. You either go where you are needed, or you propose an opportunity that didn't exist before. I loved this, especially early on in my career at Coyote, because I really didn't know what I wanted. I was able to learn a lot about the industry from many different roles, and it gave me the opportunity to figure out what I wanted for my career. I started in operations, then I moved into a sales trainer role, and from there I joined the recruiting team. Now I am back to my roots, in an operations management role. It is amazing to have the experience I have had, and I am very grateful.

Excitement ahead... The best thing about working at Coyote -- and what keeps me going every day -- is the fact that there is still so much in store for us; the excitement and changes that come with growing are not yet over. Every year here is drastically different from the last but in a good way, because you are confronted with new challenges and experiences and knowledge. It keeps you on your toes and it keeps you wanting to be a part of something bigger than yourself.

Today, Coyote Logistics has 1,263 employees.

Moving to Kayak... I was working at JumpTap, a small mobile advertising company. I joined Kayak because a really good friend of mine worked there and convinced me to come join. Kayak was exciting because of the people. I just love the people and the fact that the product was travel excited me more -- one of my passions is traveling.

Jumping around... I worked on the hotels product for the first three years as Director of Product Management and moved onto Android for a year and a half, then back to hotels again.

Getting bigger... The company has grown, and I can't recognize everyone anymore. More processes are in place and releases have become more complicated with coordination with international [teams].

Kayak culture... Fun, active and operates like a flat organization. The people and the laughter [keep me going] every day.

Today, Kayak has ~250 employees.

Better together... The team has grown fast in the time I've been at Flipboard, partly because of the acquisition of Zite. Itâ€™s really cool to see how fast weâ€™re becoming one team and learning from each other.

Working across departments... Passion and collaboration. Everyone works together, and we listen to everyoneâ€™s ideas regardless of your role. For instance, even the data team that Iâ€™m part of is involved with design for instance. We all care about creating an amazing experience for our readers.

Wearing many hats... Flipboardâ€™s mission to recreate the magazine reading experience on digital platforms and make the content discovery on the internet easier and more personalized. Plus, I love working at smaller companies because I can wear different hats and doing different tasks and grow my knowledge in different areas.

Today, Flipboard has 120 employees.

95. Charlie Harrington(Opens in a new window), Knewton(Opens in a new window)

Credit: Charlie Harrington

Destined for a startup... Before Knewton I was an investment banker at Morgan Stanley. In college I always thought I was headed for law school, but then I joined this student-run company called The Corp(Opens in a new window) and plans changed. The Corp is awesome -- itâ€™s entirely owned and run by Georgetown undergrads, and profits are donated back to students via scholarships and grants. You can start as a grocery store cashier or coffee grinder and work your way up to CEO or CFO within three or four years. The Corp is where I first became interested in business, and decided that the logical next step was to work at a place like Morgan Stanley. Banking taught me -- a mere history major -- all about spreadsheets and markets and valuation and all these other things I had never really encountered before. It was intense and challenging, and I felt for a while like I was at the center of something important. But I missed the day-to-day operations of running and growing a business, and I wanted to work at a smaller, scrappier company again. I started looking for opportunities at New York tech companies, and Knewton stood out as a startup building something that could be really transformative. Knewton seemed like a great place for me to learn from and contribute to a team working on an important problem -- how to deliver personalized learning to students and teachers around the world.

Redefining success... I think thereâ€™s this feeling among some people in my generation that ""the next five years"" are always the most critical, make-or-break years for our careers. When I decided to leave Morgan Stanley I felt like I was jumping off this train headed towards some notional definition of success, and that I might not be able to get back on the train if I didnâ€™t like what I found out there in the wilderness. I had to realize that I was after different goals, and that working at a startup where I could be learning something new every day along with a small, smart-as-hell team was the best next step for me. Now it wasnâ€™t exactly easy to find something that fit my profile -- a non-technical, finance-guy, history-major startup job seeker. But I didnâ€™t let that stop me. I still remember watching this Knewton Hack Day video from my cubicle at Morgan Stanley around 3 a.m. I knew I had to work there, if I could get them to take me.

Moving up the chain... I joined Knewton as a Business Development Analyst -- but really I was there to do just about anything I was asked. Hereâ€™s a good example of an early project: Our CEO and Founder Jose Ferreira was scheduled to speak at the Davos World Economic Forum, and he asked me to create a chart illustrating the history of education since the time of Socrates. As time went on and our API developed further, I focused more time on business development -- researching and speaking to publishers about using our API in their digital learning products, and then negotiating partnership contracts with them. Two and half years after joining Knewton, Iâ€™m now jointly running our Business Development team and reporting directly to our CEO. Even more unexpectedly, Iâ€™m heading up our first international office based in London. I definitely did not see that one coming -- Iâ€™d never even been to Europe before last year. But it goes along with that same theme of jumping at every opportunity to learn more and contribute. A couple key lessons learned along the way: (1) business development deals take take time to cultivate; (2) attitude matters -- plans will change and things will go wrong and you need to be okay with that; and (3) taking risks like joining a startup can have unexpectedly awesome results, like opening an international office for one of the world's leading ed-tech companies.

Being a Knerd... Well, we call ourselves Knerds, so that probably speaks for itself. Iâ€™ve definitely let my geek flag fly since joining Knewton: I can state with pride that I've been to at least two Star Trek: The Next Generation DVD release parties at this point. Learning from colleagues is perhaps the best part of the Knewton culture. We've got Ph.D.s, former K-12 teachers and astrophysicists at Knewton, all willing to take the time to teach someone like me more about their area of focus and expertise. During my first two months at Knewton I spent a lot of time talking to people, and I was always surprised by how much time and energy they were willing to offer to help me understand Knewton and their roles. Iâ€™ve now realized thatâ€™s just the Knewton culture. And thatâ€™s why we're focusing on maintaining that culture as we expand to London. We've brought over a team of five from NYC to help seed our European HQ with that same enthusiasm for teaching and learning.

Today, Knewton has 160 employees.

Growing sales... Before working at Blue Jeans Network, I worked at a vastly different world of pharmaceutical sales where I was just another unknown robot among 1,300 sales reps. Blue Jeans has offered me the complete opposite experience -- instead of sitting in front of a computer and toiling on the same old task everyday, I get to tackle exciting challenges at Blue Jeans as we're building a new territory (versus farming existing businesses). With only 20 other sales representatives, I have the opportunity to contribute my strategic and outside-of-box-thinking to my team and make an impact on the company. More importantly, I come to work every day feeling valued and that what I am doing is significant.

Go team... Team work is not a cliche at Blue Jeans; after every win -- no matter how big or small the deal is -- we celebrate as a team. Regardless of your position, everyone supports each other here. At the end of the day, we all aim to move the company in a positive direction, so it doesn't matter who is taking these steps. We often say that the company culture is like a pair of jeans because you can't live without each other and it's versatile and casual. This isnâ€™t just a marketing gimmick -- itâ€™s true!

Cross-department collaboration... The best things about Blue Jeans are the collaboration, support and strong relationships we have with each other and each department. Itâ€™s not the type of environment where you see people in the halls and wonder what they do. In addition, what keeps me going is celebrating milestone after milestone with each other. Itâ€™s been amazing joining a company in the early stages and watching it expand, from the inside out. I definitely look forward to celebrating more successes and continuing to grow my career at Blue Jeans!

Today, Blue Jeans has 225 employees.

Going small... I love the culture that comes with a 'small-ish' company, so I had no reservations whatsoever. I used to have my own business, so I am motivated and inspired by an entrepreneurial spirit. I think it's exciting to be a part of the growth process. Seeing all of the hard work pay off is really rewarding.

Living the brand... Directly before joining Refinery29 I was freelancing. So, I was excited about sinking my teeth into the solid task of being the Chicago voice for such a fun and inspiring brand. Also, I was always an avid reader of R29, so it was logical to want to work for a brand that I looked up on the daily.

Work hard, play hard... Everyone in this company works extremely hard - yet, everyone also knows how to have fun, too. It's the talent, creativity, and can-do attitudes that make Refinery29 such a success. It's definitely a group effort.

Today, Refinery29 has 132 employees.

Nailing the interview... I had been looking for a new opportunity with a smaller company for about a year and was hitting brick wall after brick wall. I had big company experience on my resume, but I graduated from SUNY Buffalo and never did consider myself to fit the classic definition of an academic. It seemed that all the roles I applied for were filtering for an impressive educational pedigree. Quite honestly I had developed a bit of an inferiority complex during the job search process and had an underdog mentality by the time I made it through to the interview process with MediaMath. My persistence had finally paid off, and I was motivated by the opportunity to prove to myself that I fit in with really smart people, doing bleeding edge work at a world-class level; and to learn from them. I remember leaving my interview with a sense of nervous excitement. I had prepared well and felt comfortable and confident instantly. I nailed it. Everyone I had met with was incredibly smart, driven, and fit the tech startup prototype with an Ivy League pedigree -- yet they didn't seem to care that I didnâ€™t. When I got the job offer a few days later, it was incredibly validating and I knew that this was an opportunity I'd have to be out of my mind to pass up.

Innovation excitement... I had spent three and a half years at a third party ad server that was a small technology arm of a big public digital media company. The technology was for the most part in maintenance mode. I felt stifled, uninspired, and as though no one was really interested in innovating. Everyone at MediaMath had high energy, seemed truly excited about what they were working on, and more importantly, about their ideas which turned into products that were changing an industry. I did my research on the founders, the company, and the people I'd be working with and was blown away at the prospect of not only working alongside and learning from the top visionaries in ad-tech, but also getting in on the ground floor.

Seizing the day... I've gone from being the lone sales engineer at the company, to helping to kick-start our EMEA operations with two of our co-founders Erich Wasserman and Greg Williams, to now managing three teams of solutions developers, sales engineers, and data analysts. Itâ€™s been a wild ride and Iâ€™ve taken some big steps in my career learning not only how to build out and manage teams, but also how to seize every single opportunity that presents itself at a company growing at warp speed, even if it is outside of your job description.

MediaMath culture is... Genuine. Respectful. Dedicated. Proud. Collaborative. Innovative. Accountable. Empowering. We truly own our careers here and are empowered to influence the organization by identifying opportunities and priorities. We hire very strongly on culture fit and every person from the top down is simply intelligent, good-natured and down to earth. So down to earth, that the CEO will even refuse to take the first class seat that a brand new sales engineer somehow got on the flight back from Minneapolis, while he gets shuffled back to his middle seat in economy. Yes, even if you ask multiple times throughout the flight. (Thanks, Joe!) With great power comes great responsibility, so we work hard but we also like to have fun to celebrate our accomplishments. There are regular trivia nights, happy hours, and team outings. Iâ€™ve also made some incredible friends here - the kind of friends that will go to great lengths to wrap your entire desk and all of its contents in Disney Princess wrapping paper for your birthday. A lot of us hang out on the weekends and spend time outside of the office going to concerts, playing sports, and even taking vacations together.

Today, MediaMath has 375 employees.

Redesigning the role... When I started at IDEO I designed and engineered physical products which had already been largely defined by the client. At one point I grew into a management role in the company, but found I missed the challenge and satisfaction inherent in creating design solutions. Today my role starts much further upstream in the process, usually leading a project team. I participate in in-context design research, synthesize findings, identify unmet needs and opportunities for our clients, and create strategic road maps for addressing those opportunities. Ideally, I get to follow through, creating concepts to populate the strategic road map and grow the clientâ€™s offerings.

The whole enchilada... Just as my role as evolved, the company and our design process has evolved to fit the much greater scope and diversity in the kinds of work we do. When I joined IDEO most of company was made up of engineers and industrial designers. Today we have people from many disciplines, including interaction design, food science, behavioral economics, design research and communication design. The broadening of our capabilities means that not only can we design a product, but we can also design the digital interface, the service it is part of, the business that delivers it, and finally the brand which sets the stage. Client interaction has become much greater than ever as we work together with them as partners and collaborators. Often projects include teaching client teams how to work like we do and even mentor them as they adopt our approach to innovation in their organization. All these aspects align with our shared desire to achieve ever more broad and deep impact in the world through design.

Positive synergy... IDEOâ€™s culture is about people working together with a shared commitment to excellence in their work and in supporting each other through collaboration and the sharing of ideas, tools and experience. An atmosphere of trust in each otherâ€™s capabilities and commitment means that we can focus our energy and attention on doing the right thing, delivering the best we can within the time and budget available. Most people at IDEO are over-achievers who love to challenge themselves to stretch and experiment. That spirit is infectious, gently pushing everyone to try new ways to work, evolving and growing our process.

Being open... The best thing about working at IDEO is the constant stimulation and learning driven by the broad variety of challenges we take on, the daily interaction with colleagues with diverse backgrounds, strengths and passions, and the pervasive openness to acting on new ideas early and often.

Today, IDEO has 600+ employees.

Living the brand... I wanted to join a company whose product I used every day. I heard rumors that Spotify was opening an office there, and pinged a few people to get interviews. I was excited that the service hadn't even launched in the U.S., and I got to help shape the developer ecosystem. When I joined Spotify in 2011, there were only a handful of people in the New York City office. I didn't have reservations about joining a small company because I love the startup mentality and free flow of ideas.

Launching the U.S. dev ecosystem... I got the chance to help build the developer community from scratch. Three years later, we have hundreds of apps using our platform and a community of developers that give us awesome feedback so we can make better APIs and products.

Staying committed... The company has grown considerably since I started at Spotify. We have built up a very strong engineering team in the US since then too. The culture has changed for the better, with more a more diverse range of people joining the company who give us insight into building the best music platform. The main thing that has stayed the same is the commitment to quality, which has only gotten richer over the years, I've noticed.

Swedish influence... I love that Spotify started a Swedish company. The Swedes have a concept called 'lagom', which is a mentality that means to focus on doing exactly what's needed and doing it well, rather than doing unnecessary things. We work hard, but have an equal amount of fun to balance it out.

7025752,Fruit of the Loom Goes High End With European Pop-Up Stores,"Walk into the pop-up store on trendy Torstrasse in Berlin and the first things you'll see are giant foam artworks in the shape of fruit: an apple core the height of a medium-size woman, a towering watermelon spear, a citrus slice as big as a train station clock. In the next room, cotton-blend jersey pieces in a subdued palette dominated by grays and blues hang on the racks.

Check the price tag on that T-shirt dress with the intriguing print and you would never guess (foam fruit notwithstanding) that this line of super-chic sweatshirt wear is the work of Fruit of the Loom.

At â‚¬130 ($180) for the dress (regular T-shirts start at â‚¬50), Seek No Further, Fruit of the Loom's new premium brand, is certainly a departure from the down-to-earth basics the company is known for at home and abroad. On Walmart.com, a four-pack of men's crewneck tees sells for under $15.

The differences don't end with the price point. The new collection, which includes 17 pieces for men and 17 for women, is downright exclusive. Conceived by DorothÃ©e Loermann, a Parisian fashion designer with a cult following, the clothes are well-made and hard to come by: The line is available only at two pop-up stores, one in Berlin, the other in London. These temporary stores, with bespoke decorations created by contemporary artists riffing on the fruit theme, opened in March and will close at the end of July. There is a website(Opens in a new window), which like the stores makes very little of the brand's parentage. There's no merchandise for sale, but plenty of videos showcasing up-and-coming artists, filmmakers, animators, and photographers from Germany and the U.K. The overall feel is very indie.

Seek No Further is an experiment, one that aims to capitalize on the nostalgia Europeans feel for an import of their youth. Fruit of the Loom launched in Europe at the end of the 1970s and quit the market a decade later. The company still supplies T-shirts and sweatshirts to printers for, say, sports paraphernalia, though often without the Fruit of the Loom logo.

""In Europe, there are great memories associated with the brand,"" says Antoine Thieser, Seek No Further's business developer. ""It was really popular in the '80s and '90s-Fruit of the Loom and Levi's 501s, this was the uniform of the '90s.""

""In the U.S., it doesn't have the same sexiness,"" adds Thieser. ""Everybody here has a story of the brand-'Oh, it reminds me of when I was young'-there are so many things people were doing in these T-shirts!""

""We thought, we should do something with all this really positive equity.""

For the new brand, the all-European design team headed by Loermann traveled to Kentucky to delve into Fruit of the Loom's archives, which stretch back to the company's founding in the 1800s. (The name for the new line comes from a 19th century advertisement for a kind of heirloom apple called Westfield Seek-No-Further).

The designers took inspiration from vintage fabrics, stitches, and concepts, but designed a slick, modern look with a focus on unusual or surprising fabrics, such as a wool-blend sweatshirt or a cotton top with a touch of neoprene woven into the fabric. ""We had to reinvent the sweatshirt,"" says Thieser. ""We tried to source exclusive fabric. It has to be special, surprising to the touch.""

They also played with new ideas: That â‚¬130 T-shirt dress, for example, has a print that recalls the blurriness of a TV screen-a reference to MTV. ""We thought, in Europe, not everyone knows about this long history of Fruit of the Loom in the 1800s, but everyone remembers the 1980s and MTV.""

Another piece includes a subtle print of lamb chops and apples-the first time meat has been featured in a Fruit of the Loom garment. ""We wanted to go back to the roots without being vintage,"" explains Thieser. ""We're not like Levi's, where you go to the archives and reproduce something. We went to the archive as a source of inspiration.""

A small, incubator-like team of 10 people based in London was in charge of the design of the clothing and that of the pop-up stores. The line was produced in Portugal, Italy, Slovakia, and China, at factories that don't regularly produce goods for Fruit of the Loom.",4/14/2014 0:00,0.647059,6,2,0,4.717791,8,Tech,1212.333,3830.235,2917.42,3600,0.330969,0.023508,0.03681,0.055215,0.5,-0.2,262

7025679,"Heartbleed Exposes a Problem With Open Source, But It's Not What You Think","A week after the Heartbleed OpenSSL vulnerability wreaked havoc across the web, the conversation is shifting from reaction to reflection. The discussion is no longer about what to do now, but what can be done to prevent another Heartbleed from happening in the future. In other words, we're entering the blame game chapter in this saga.

So who is to blame for Heartbleed?

If OpenSSL, the software package at the root of the vulnerability, were a piece of commercial software, we could blame the company behind the app. In fact, when Apple released an emergency patch for its own SSL/TLS bug back in February, the company was scrutinized by security experts, programmers and pundits a like.

But OpenSSL isn't a commercial program. It's an open-source project maintained by a small group of committers and volunteers.

Because OpenSSL is open source, there isn't an immediate figure or organization to blame. Are we really going to blame unpaid software engineers who commit to a project that 66% of the Internet uses for free?

So if you can't blame an entity -- the first recourse for some -- is the model of open-source software itself to blame?

Linus's Law Didn't Fail

Over the last 15 years, open-source software has developed a reputation for being secure and reliable. Open-source code can actually be more reliable than proprietary (or, closed-source) code because there are more users looking at it to find bugs and security holes.

In Eric S. Raymond's seminal essay on open source, The Cathedral and the Bazaar, he defines Linus's Law(Opens in a new window) (named for the father of the Linux kernel, Linus Torvalds), which states that ""given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow."" In other words. If enough users are looking at the code, bugs and problems will be found.

Raymond argues that this distinction is one of the reasons that open-source software is inherently safer than proprietary code. After all, it has more people looking at it, capable of finding and repairing bugs.

In the wake of Heartbleed and other open-source security failures(Opens in a new window), some have questioned whether Linus's Law still holds true.

The argument is that if this was a commercially backed project with a well-funded development team of full-time professionals, rather than the volunteers and committers that currently make-up OpenSSL, the coding process and auditing process would have better.

But we can't know that. Apple's SSL/TLS bug (which was much smaller than the Heartbleed bug in both scope and in threat), existed for more than a year before Apple engineers found the bug and released patches. Yes, that library was also open source, but it was maintained by Apple employees, and Apple had to approve any outside contributions.

I summarized my thoughts on what Heartbleed means for open source on Twitter last week:

Heartbleed is no more an indictment of open source than apple's ssl bug is an indictment of closed systems. Shit happens. Period.â€” Christina Warren (@film_girl) April 10, 2014(Opens in a new window)

Although I disagree with Raymond that open source is inherently more secure than other types of code, I agree with him that Heartbleed does not refute Linus' Law(Opens in a new window). Yes, the Heartbleed bug went unidentified for more than two years, but it was caught -- and caught by two different parties -- because the code was open.

Heartbleed is not a failure of open source, at least not the way you may think. There is absolutely no reason to believe that Heartbleed happened because it was an open-source project powered by volunteers.

But if Heartbleed doesn't refute Linus's Law, that doesn't mean that this situation still doesn't put the spotlight on what really can hamper an open-source project: Lack of resources.

Open Source

One of the hallmarks of open-source software -- in fact, a big part of its appeal -- is that it is free to use and modify.

Open-source software isn't always ""free as in beer"" (as Free Software Foundation leader and GNU(Opens in a new window) founder Richard Stallman likes to say), but more often than not, companies don't have to pay anything to access or implement open-source code into their projects.

In fact, it's this ""free"" aspect that has led to the mass adoption of open-source in various industries. Although proprietary software (or software that is a mix of proprietary and open-source) still dominates many industries -- open source has really found its place on the web.

Microsoft might be the world's largest software maker, but most web servers don't run Windows; they run Linux and a web server application such as Apache or Nginx. Why? Because Microsoft charges for its software. For a small business, running Linux might translate into relatively small savings. As a business grows, however, those savings can become quite substantial.

If Facebook or Google had to pay a license for every server or virtual server it operates -- and another license for its web server -- its business plan would be completely different.

This is even more true when open-source software -- especially related to servers and security -- has a track record that is as good or better than proprietary solutions.

Beyond that, the great thing about open source is that anyone can take a project or part of a project and build something else on top of it. And depending on the license, those changes often have to be shared with everyone else. That often leads to even better(Opens in a new window) results.

But of course, nothing is really free. Maintaining and supporting software -- open source or not -- has a cost. Major (as in popular in size and in scope) open-source projects are generally funded in three ways:

Donations from individuals, volunteers (by time or coding abilities) and non-profits.

The project is funded and steered by a commercial entity or entities.

Corporations who use and benefit from the project hire employees who are dedicated to working on the project full-time.

The Debian Linux distribution is funded by volunteers and by non-profit donations. It is one of the few completely community driven projects without a corporate sponsor.

Ubuntu, another Linux distribution (which is based on Debian), is sponsored by Canonical. Volunteers still make up a big part of the project, but Canonical ensures that full-time employees are paid.

Red Hat was one of the first companies to build a successful business off of open-source and free software. Although it makes the source code for its projects available to everyone, it sells software and service contracts for its flagship Red Hat Enterprise Linux and other products. Red Hat also sponsors community projects such as Fedora and CentOS.

Companies including Red Hat and IBM also donate employees to work full-time on important projects, including the Linux Kernel.

The WebKit project, which is the basis for the Safari browser (and until 2013, Google Chrome), is sponsored and maintained by Apple.

Over the last 15 years, most companies that benefit tremendously from open source -- including but not limited to Amazon, Google, Facebook, IBM, Cisco and Twitter -- also give back code, employee time and money to the projects that are most important to their business and product.

But not every project gets the type of attention or funding that it needs.

OpenSSL: Used By Many, Supported By Few

As the defacto SSL/TLS cryptographic stack on the web, it might be easy to think that OpenSSL has tons of support.

After all, as we've learned from Heartbleed -- it's not just web servers that use OpenSSL. Routers (big, expensive, high-end routers), firewalls, smartphones and other connected devices all use OpenSSL.

If the number of people that relied on a project -- and its importance to the overall web -- was proportionally related to the amount of support a project has, OpenSSL would be well-funded and have a heft of full-time paid employees and maintainers.

It's not.

OpenSSL, a project that runs on 66% of all web servers, has just one full-time employee. One.

It gets worse. In the five years since the OpenSSL Software Foundation(Opens in a new window) (OSF) was created -- as a way to help sustain the OpenSSL project -- this important project has never received more than $1 million in gross revenue a year.

Pure donations to the project are almost non-existent. Steve Marquess, the OpenSSL contributor who handles the business aspects of the OSF, addressed the current situation(Opens in a new window) on his blog. According to Marquess, the foundation typically gets just $2,000 a year in donations.

Marquess writes (emphasis ours):

Even if those donations continue to arrive at the same rate indefinitely (they won't), and even though every penny of those funds goes directly to OpenSSL team members, it is nowhere near enough to properly sustain the manpower levels needed to support such a complex and critical software product. While OpenSSL does ""belong to the people"" it is neither realistic nor appropriate to expect that a few hundred,* or even a few thousand, individuals provide all the financial support. The ones who should be contributing real resources are the commercial companies and governments who use OpenSSL extensively and take it for granted.*

The rest of the money -- that under $1 million figure -- doesn't come from volunteered employees or corporate stewardship or even support contracts. It comes from work-for-hire contracts.

That is, companies pay members of the OpenSSL team (there are six core committers -- only one of which is able to make OpenSSL his full-time job) $250 an hour to work on a project related to OpenSSL for that company.

Even at $250 an hour, the fact that very few OpenSSL team members exist (which is partially due to the high skill requirements and lack of guaranteed income) means that existing contract work is often unstaffed, and thus, unpaid.

So what's the solution? Well, Marquess would rather have OpenSSL funded via support contracts. In the footnotes, he writes:

Here's a plug for one of the most effective ways your corporation can not only support OpenSSL but also receive something of tangible value in return: a software support contract. We have a formal contract with the fine print that lawyers love, and your accounts payable people won't be all flummoxed at the bizarre notion of giving money away as they're used to paying for expensive commercial support contracts for proprietary software. Someday you may even encounter an issue with your mission critical use of OpenSSL that could benefit from direct and prompt attention from the people who wrote that code.

He also makes mention of the fact that lots of big companies are already taking advantage of OpenSSL in their commercial products and not contributing back.

I'm looking at you, Fortune 1000 companies. The ones who include OpenSSL in your firewall/appliance/cloud/financial/security products that you sell for profit, and/or who use it to secure your internal infrastructure and communications. The ones who don't have to fund an in-house team of programmers to wrangle crypto code, and who then nag us for free consulting services when you can't figure out how to use it. The ones who have never lifted a finger to contribute to the open source community that gave you this gift. You know who you are.

So What's the Solution?

On Hacker News(Opens in a new window), some commenters criticized the OSF's approach of doing contract work as a way to fund the project. I think this is a fair assessment.

A project of the nature of OpenSSL really should be funded by support contracts or by corporate sponsors agreeing to pay the salary of cryptography experts to work on OpenSSL full-time.

With no disrespect intended towards any member of the OpenSSL team or the OSF, part of the problem also appears to be that the project lacks strong leadership -- at least in the way that could put a plan in motion to ensure that resources required to keep the project running successfully (and not the part-time gig for a few individuals and the full-time job for one person) are in place.

The OSF itself could also do a better job being transparent about who its sponsors are (and the nature of the projects it works on), as well as doing larger calls for funding and support contracts.

Having said that, because this is not a commercial endeavor, its unfair to hold the project to the same standard as we would a commercial entity. Maybe if companies can't donate employees to work on the code, they can donate people to help with some of the public-facing and fundraising aspects of the foundation.

I do hope that the largest companies that benefit from OpenSSL -- especially those who use the software in their commercial hardware products and security consoles -- will see Heartbleed as a wake-up call. Not to abandon OpenSSL and move to a paid solution -- but to do a better job giving back to the project and community.

More support could also mean more improvements to the code itself -- and to the whole process. Yes, it's possible that even with a team of well-paid engineers, code auditors and support staff, Heartbleed could still have happened. I would imagine finding this bug would be like trying to find a typo in Ulysses.

The difference is that a better-staffed project would mean that making changes and improvements to the code-auditing and code-review processes would be more feasible. That makes for a better end product, which means that everyone using OpenSSL would have the advantages of a safer, more stable and feature-rich product.

Heartbleed didn't happen because OpenSSL is open source, it happened because the project wasn't given the support it needed. Let's hope that changes. And soon.

5371572,The Heartbleed Effect: Password Services Are Having a Moment,"Joe Siegrist was dropping off his son at school on Tuesday morning when he got a phone call from his staff: Heartbleed was even worse than they thought.

News of the security bug first came out the previous day, April 7, after Siegrist and much of his team at LastPass, a password security company, had already left the office for the day. It wasn't until the following morning they learned Heartbleed potentially allowed attackers to extract 64 kilobyte batches of memory at random.

""That is significantly worse than most bugs that occur,"" Siegrist, CEO of LastPass, told Mashable. ""You don't know what exactly was in the payload of those Heartbleed messages: It could be user names and passwords. It could be financial data. It could be the SSL certificate, which is especially bad.""

""It was definitely a 'holy sh*t' moment,"" he says.

When Siegrist got to the company's headquarters in Fairfax, Va., that morning, he addressed the entire office, briefing them on the updates and lay out the plan. Half of the developers, about eight people, dropped everything and focused on making sure any SSL certificates were revoked and reissued for LastPass.com. The other half of the team went to work on building a tool(Opens in a new window) that would help users identify impacted websites and determine whether they should change their passwords right away, or wait.

The LastPass Heartbleed checker was cited by a number of top publications and news programs and quickly became a go-to source for concerned Internet users to assess the risk posed by the security bug. The tool has had more than 3.8 million views in the less than a week since it launched, and it has been used for 4.5 million lookups.

Moreover, LastPass is seeing a tremendous surge in the number of people creating accounts. The company added 125,000 new users over the last week, compared to 35,000 or so in a normal week. LastPass is free, but a premium version sells for $1 a month.

""It's definitely good for business, which is a paradox,"" says Siegrist, who founded LastPass in 2008 and has been working to reach more of a mainstream audience. ""Do I want it to happen like this? No, I don't. But if any good can come out of it...""

LastPass isn't the only password management service experiencing a surge in popularity as a result of the Heartbleed bug. 1Password, a service from AgileBits, saw a ""tenfold"" increase in traffic to its website and its paid iPhone app jumped into the top 10 in the U.S. last week from the low-200s previously.

""We are getting a lot of customers who have heard of Heartbleed and they haven't really thought significantly of their internet security until now,"" says Jeff Shiner, CEO of 1Password. ""It's one of those things that in peoples' minds is always happening to somebody else.""

Emmanuel Schalit, CEO of Dashlane, another password manager, says his company experienced a ""10x"" surge in new users at its peak over the last week. Traffic to Dashlane didn't peak until a couple days after Heartbleed was discovered. As with the other password security companies we spoke with, traffic remains much higher than normal a week later.

""I think it's going to last for awhile,"" Schalit says. ""The news story will die down as with any news story, but I think it will create a step change in the market and awareness.""

In an effort to keep the momentum going, Dashlane is suggesting customers tell their friends about the importance of taking extra password precautions. LastPass, meanwhile, is working to simplify its customer education tools so that its easier for new users to get started and stay engaged -- with or without another Heartbleed.

""Before it was if you were in the know, you used a password manager, but it has always been a struggle to get that out to a mainstream audience,"" says Erin Styles, VP of marketing for LastPass. ""We're trying to set up better general education for getting started with one.""

Is Heartbleed the first Internet bug with its own Web site? http://t.co/M9u976X9ui(Opens in a new window) Also, whither SSL?â€” Lance Ulanoff (@LanceUlanoff) April 9, 2014(Opens in a new window)

Heartbleed.com(Opens in a new window) was a revelation. First of all, the OpenSSL encryption bug had its own logo: the outline of a red heart, ominously dripping blood. It's simple, powerful and most importantly memorable. Codenomicon's Heartbleed FAQ was the clearest security information page I had ever come across. It did not read as if it was written by a company that busies itself testing SSL for the Tier 1 network providers. It was smart and comprehensive, yet utterly comprehensible.

By creating a Heartbleed information destination, Codenomicon spread the news more effectively than if they had run a half dozen commercials on TV. The FAQ did a great job, but it didn't give us the story behind the story -- how did Codenomicon do it, and why?

[seealso slug=""heartbleed-bug-websites-affected""]

As we enter week two of Heartbleed awareness, Codenomicon CMO Hope Frank took some time out of her busy schedule to answer our questions via email:

Q: Just how dangerous is Heartbleed at this point? Some say it's worse than we initially thought, others say it's being blown out of proportion.

A: It should be taken seriously. There are numerous services that have not been updated, perhaps partially because of this argument about seriousness or irrelevant topics related to the vulnerability. They key challenge currently is to help people hear about it, and convince them to react quickly. Everyone who was running an affected version of the software and hosting confidential data or devices that are part of critical infrastructure should a) build new secret keys, b) request new certificates and c) Direct everyone to change passwords.

Q: What prompted your team to look for it? Did you get a tip?

A: No. This was part of testing of new features and capabilities in our SSL/TLS fuzzing tools.

Q: Who named it? (I know the name refers to the Heartbeat portion of the code.)

A: Ossi Herrala, one of our experts working on the issue in our Oulu, Finland headquarters.

Q: Were there any rejected logos?

A: Yes.

Q: Can we see them?

A: No. Please note this was not a marketing exercise. Our key goal in all of our FAQ materials at our Heartbleed site was to communicate the significance to several actors using OpenSSL in security-critical places â€“ before â€“ disclosure. After OpenSSL published the vulnerability, we released the FAQ site

Q: Have you created sites devoted to other vulnerabilities or attacks?

A: No. See here(Opens in a new window) for previously reported flaws.

Q: Who are your clients?

A: We produce testing tools for detection of unknown â€œzero-dayâ€ vulnerabilities using technique called model-based fuzzing. Our customers are tier-1 network equipment manufacturers, operators, and carriers, and infrastructure builders. Our tools are also used by security experts proving security assessment services. Another product line for us is focused on situational awareness and automated handling of Network Abuse. This is used in more than 10 national certs around the world, including CERT-FI.

Who are your competitors?

We have not run across competitors. Most of the security testing companies focus only on the web application layer. The market has been mostly ""add-on"" security; we are more into ""build-in"" security.

When were you founded?

2001.

How big is the company?

120 people world-wide.

There's no way of knowing if we'll ever see the likes of Heartbleed again. What is clear is that we haven't heard the last of this dangerous security fault.

In the meantime, Codenomicon may have created the model for all future security alerts. Let's just hope that future full-court-press branding is reserved for the truly dangerous ones.

7025543,'Mad Men' Recap: Still Seeking Satisfaction When 'Having It All' Isn't Enough,"""Are you ready? Because I want you to pay attention. This is the beginning of something.""

Those three sentences delivered by Freddy Rumsen direct-to-camera lead off a potential ad campaign pitch for Accutron watches. But ultimately, Freddy's speech marks the beginning of the end for AMC's beloved and highly-stylized period drama, Mad Men.

Mad Men's seventh and final season picks up in January 1969, a handful of months following season six's finale that left Don Draper's personal and professional life in turmoil: the partners at SC&P informed Don that he'll need to take a leave of absence from the company with no set return date following a slew of unprofessional incidents; and Don's marriage to Megan continued to buckle under the weight of his self-destructive ways, climaxing with word that the couple's move to California would have to be cancelled, even though Megan had left her job in New York to start over in Los Angeles.

Mad Men's premiere does not offer us our whiskey-drinking antihero until several scenes in, instead opening with Freddy in conversation with Peggy Olson over Accutron. Penned by series creator Matthew Weiner and titled Time Zones, the episode does not shy away from winking at its audience with allusions to the impending sunset of the series -- as Freddy finishes his Accutron speech, for example, Peggy says in awe, ""That's a home run ... Actually, it's kind of an end-run.""

With Don on leave from the advertising company, Bob Benson in Detroit, and Ted Chaough and Pete Campbell now based in Los Angeles, it's still business as usual at SC&P. Lou Avery now occupies Don's office and runs creative, though he lacks the brilliance and finesse of Don -- and routinely butts heads with Peggy. Ken Cosgrove (eye patch and all) is frustrated with his lack of mid-level ad men to carry some of the workload, and struggles with Bob and Pete's distance from the office. Without any ""underlings"" to handle meetings with clients, Ken barks at Joan Harris to cancel his meeting with Butler Shoes' new head of marketing. Joan, as we find out, quickly takes matters into her own hands.

We finally rendezvous with Don a few thousand miles away -- at LAX, to be precise. Megan picks Don up from the airport for his short visit to Los Angeles, whisking him away in a convertible. Though Don canned the California move in the previous season, we learn Megan still went forward with her plans to transition to LA and pursue her TV acting career. A bicoastal marriage has since unfolded between Megan and Don, though the distance between them takes shape beyond airline miles and time zones -- Megan has delved into the Angeleno artist lifestyle, while Don is still very much a Madison Avenue ad man (albeit, one with a complicated employment situation).

SEE ALSO: Gaze Into the Dreamy Eyes of Don Draper

Following a dinner with Megan's rep, Megan and Don return to her house situated high above Los Angeles in the hills. Megan, though, is too drunk to consummate his arrival in her city, leaving Don to sleep alone on the couch. Later, Don surprises Megan by purchasing her a large TV where she can watch herself on. Megan snaps at Don, noting that the pricy television is embarrassing to have given how broke her fellow acting friends are in LA.

Nevertheless, the two try to make their marriage work, even though Don confesses later in the episode that Megan knows heâ€™s a â€œterrible husband.â€

As Don visits LA, Ted returns to New York for a quick trip to SC&P. Conflict between Peggy and Ted has not been resolved, instead melting into an awkward tension. To recap, Ted professed his love to Peggy and said he would leave his wife for her at the end of season six, but got cold feet and begged Don to let him be the one to move to California in order to get a nationâ€™s worth of space between him and Peggy, and save his family and marriage. Ted appears happy during his current trip to New York, but Peggy, living alone in the city (and apparently managing her apartment complex), still harbors deep resentment toward Ted.

Instead of canceling Kenâ€™s meeting with Butler Shoesâ€™ head of marketing, Joan boldly decides to attend in his place -- and quickly learns that Butler is aiming to exit SC&P in order to establish an in-house advertising department. Realizing that sheâ€™s in over her head when it comes to navigating such complex client waters, Joan turns to a business professor for advice on how to keep Butler Shoes as a client. Joanâ€™s interaction with both men -- the marketing chief and university professor -- showcases not only the sexism still present in 1969, but Joanâ€™s tenacity when it comes to making herself essential to SC&P. Though Butlerâ€™s head of marketing, the biz professor and even Ken all underestimate Joan, she surprises all three with her business savvy, even leading the Butler exec to seek advice towards the end of the episode -- â€œTell me what I should do,â€ he asks Joan.

Pete is happier (and tanner) than heâ€™s ever been now that heâ€™s based in Los Angeles. He and Don grab a bite at Canters Deli before Pete offers Don a tour of SC&Pâ€™s petite but upscale LA office. He tells Don about his apartment near the Tar Pits, and introduces him to a young real estate agent who is helping Pete shop for a house -- and dating Pete, evidently.

Roger Sterling, we learn, has fallen into a deep rut. We reunite with Roger in his bedroom early in the episode, him naked and asleep on the floor next to several young, naked hippies and the remainders of last nightâ€™s party. He receives a call from his daughter, Margaret, who suggests they get a bite to eat together to make amends. During the brunch, Margaret tells her father that she forgives him for his â€œtransgressionsâ€ and abandoning her mother, and confesses she has done some soul searching to release anger and embrace love in her life. Roger bucks at Margaretâ€™s new way of thinking, even though he now associates with hippies that embody the Free Love movement of the â€˜60s and â€˜70s. Rogerâ€™s involvement with these hippies, as it turns out, is more due to use of substances, rather than actual new age substance. Though he literally has more people in his bed than ever, Roger has little to hold onto in life now, and doesnâ€™t fully process his daughterâ€™s words.

Don flies back to New York on a redeye, and finds himself seated next to a beautiful woman -- Lee Cabot, played by Neve Campbell. Lee and Don fall into conversation during the flight, and she reveals her husband passed a year ago due to â€œthirstâ€ -- alcoholism. Lee tells Don her husband led a fast-paced work life like Don, and was sent to the hospital by his company. It is here that Weiner offers us foreboding dialogue that resonates with both Don and the viewer.

â€œI thought he was really getting better. Then, a doctor told me heâ€™d be dead in a year,â€ Lee says. â€œAll of them would be.â€

Don confesses to Lee that he feels â€œlike a broken vesselâ€ at this stage in his life, possibly a reference to a Biblical psalm -- â€œI am forgotten as a dead man, out of mind; I am like a broken vessel.â€ Before landing, Lee propositions Don, suggesting he continue to keep his transgressions from Megan and go home with her after the flight. Don, however, turns down the offer, and heads home to meet with Freddy at Donâ€™s apartment.

Don, we realize, has been using Freddy to pitch his ad ideas to SC&P. Why Don has continued to do covert work for the firm is not entirely clear, though he is still being paid during his leave. Freddy reminds Don how important it is to return to SC&P soon in order to not be â€œdamaged goodsâ€ -- and after all, Freddy would know, since he once was told to take a leave of absence from the firm in order to get dry.

Unbeknownst to Peggy, the Accutron pitch was all Donâ€™s. This revelation exemplifies the strong connection between Don and Peggy -- though unaware of Donâ€™s involvement, Peggy nevertheless champions Donâ€™s ideas at SC&P. In her private life, however, Peggyâ€™s loneliness is wearing on her. As her brother-in-law, Gerry, leaves her apartment, Peggy questions whether he should go all the way back to Brooklyn at such a late hour. â€œI donâ€™t like Anita [his wife] alone in the houseâ€ at night, Gerry says as he departs, thereby leaving Peggy alone in her apartment. After Gerry exits, Peggy breaks down in her apartment, sobbing by herself.

The season premiere ends with Don deciding to not drink before sleeping alone in his apartment. He tries to close his balconyâ€™s sliding glass doors, but theyâ€™re jammed open, letting in a cold January draft. Frustrated, Don surrenders to the weather, slides open the doors and goes outside. He sits in the cold night air, shivering violently in little more than a robe and boxers -- no woman, no alcohol to comfort him.

Weiner does not deprive â€œMad Menâ€ fans of the historical and literary references that his show has become known for in this season premiere. While Megan sleeps next to him in LA, Don watches 1937â€™s â€œLost Horizonâ€ on the new television. Pages of text appear on screen: â€œIn these days of wars and rumors of wars, havenâ€™t you ever dreamed of a place where there was peace and security, where living was not a struggle but a lasting delight? Of course you have. So has every man since Time began. Always the same dream. Sometimes he calls it Utopia, sometimes the Fountain of Youth, sometimes merely â€˜that little chicken farm.â€™â€ The â€œLost Horizonâ€ quote underscores one of the fundamental conflicts that has traced its way throughout â€œMad Menâ€™sâ€ series run: how does one discover a sense of satisfaction with life, when â€œhaving it allâ€ is not enough?

But more symbolic is Nixonâ€™s inaugural speech, which Don watches while polishing his shoes before Freddyâ€™s arrival.

â€œWe are caught in war, wanting peace,â€ Nixon says. â€œWe are torn by division, wanting unity. We see around us empty lives, wanting fulfillment. We see tasks that need doing, waiting for hands to do them.â€ This Nixon bit almost perfectly summarizes the challenges that â€œMad Menâ€™sâ€ characters face during the showâ€™s concluding season -- marriages are divided by space and differences; SC&P is fragmented in various offices and lacks cohesion; families are split up; and ultimately, our leads including Don, Peggy, Roger and Joan are still seeking emotional fulfillment.

Whether these characters and others will find the satisfaction they crave will be determined during â€œMad Menâ€™sâ€ split final season -- the first half airing this spring, the second half in 2015. But Leeâ€™s words on the plane will be manifested in one way or another: Don Draper will be gone in a year ... all of them will be.",4/14/2014 0:00,0.566572,9,1,0,4.396648,7,00000,1577.778,50650,9865.97,34166.67,0.48403,0.109076,0.03352,0.013966,0.9,0.5,1200

Though the vote had been expected Tuesday, a source with knowledge of the deal said Monday that the it already been taken to approve the deal, which still needs regulatory approval. The statement from Maker backed up that claim.

7025561,Olympic God Michael Phelps Ends Retirement. Is Rio 2016 in Sight?,"Joining the ranks of Michael Jordan, Brett Favre and other superstar athletes who retired from their respective sports and then reversed those decisions, Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps is hopping back in the pool, prompting speculation that he's eyeing another Olympic appearance at the 2016 Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

Phelps, 28, will compete at the Arena Grand Prix in Mesa, Ariz., from April 24-26, his coach told the Associated Press(Opens in a new window) on Monday. This will be his first time competing since the 2012 Olympics.

[seealso url = ""http://mashable.com/2014/03/30/michael-phelps-15""]

Phelps won four gold medals and two silver medals at the London Games in 2012 and a record eight gold medals at the Beijing games in 2008. (Overall, he has earned 22 Olympic medals, 18 of them gold, in his career.) Phelps retired after the 2012 Games, saying he didn't want to continue as a professional swimmer into his 30s.

But Phelps' coach, Bob Bowman, said on Monday that the superstar has been training with his team at the North Baltimore Aquatic Club for five days a week.

""He's gotten back into good shape since September,"" Bowman told the AP. ""He can give a good effort and certainly not be embarrassed. He's in enough shape to swim competitively.""

Phelps himself had remained mum on the subject, both to reporters and on social media, at time of writing.

Officially ending his retirement would be Phelps' logical first step if he wants to compete in Rio in 2016, or get back into competing internationally at all. But Bowman told the AP that such speculation is premature. Phelps would still need to progress through several steps to qualify for the 2016 Olympics.

Bowman said Phelps' participation in the U.S. National Championships this August -- where swimmers will compete to represent the U.S. at the 2015 world championships -- will depend on his early races.

""I wouldn't say it's 100% on the radar,"" Bowman said of the U.S. National Championships. ""After Mesa, we're going to sit down and talk about it.""

With the thirst for greatness Phelps has shown since he was a teenager, though, it's hard to imaging the Olympic god is simply testing these waters.

7005602,Is This Mystery Artwork the Latest Banksy?,"Banksy, the acclaimed but still anonymous UK street artist, is thought to be the source of a new piece of artwork that was found on the side of a home in southwest England.

The piece, which surrounds a telephone box, features what appears to be three spies dressed in identical brown trench coats holding recording equipment.

Karen Smith, 48, the owner of the Cheltenham house, told the Gloucestershire Echo(Opens in a new window) that she heard noise throughout the night, but didn't investigate because the area she lives in is pretty busy normally.

When Smith awoke Sunday morning at around 7:30 a.m., she saw men putting a white tarpaulin in a van parked outside the house. She only noticed the graffiti when she saw other people checking it out.

Smith's verdict on the art adorning her home? ""It's pretty good,"" she told the newspaper. ""It livens up the street a bit.""

There is still some debate as to whether the piece is a true Banksy, as it has not yet been posted to the artist's official website(Opens in a new window) or social media accounts. It was, however, done in a style reminiscent of other Banksy works.

It's not hard to see the graffiti as a comment on surveillance, given that Britain's Government Communications Headquarters(Opens in a new window) (GCHQ) -- the UK equivalent of the NSA -- is based in Cheltanham.

""This is the first time we have ever been asked to comment on art,"" a GCHQ spokesman told the Echo. ""Although we are not qualified critics, we are as intrigued as the rest of the residents of Cheltenham about the appearance of the mysterious artwork.""

Suspicion for the attack immediately fell on Boko Haram, an Islamist militant group that is active in the region, after Goodluck Jonathan, the country's president, visited the scene of the attack and vowed that the country would defeat the insurgency.

â€œThe issue of Boko Haram is temporary,"" he said(Opens in a new window). â€œWe promise that we will get over it.â€

The group, whose name means ""Western education is sinful,"" has been behind a number of attacks in the region in recent years.

Nearly 30 boys were killed(Opens in a new window) as they slept in school dormitories in February, when gunmen associated with Boko Haram stormed the grounds. As many as 50 may have been killed in a similar attack(Opens in a new window) last September. And 50 were killed(Opens in a new window) in a string of church bombings in 2012.

The group bombed Abuja's United Nations building in 2011, too.

7005592,Why Drink From a Water Bottle When You Can Eat This Blob Instead?,"No water bottle? No problem.

Ooho, a biodegradable, water balloon-like blob, could soon be a cheap, environmentally friendly alternative to the ubiquitous plastic bottle.

[seealso slug=""filtration-water-bottles""]

Up to nearly 50% of 2.4 million tons of discarded plastic comes from plastic water bottles, according to the Clean Air Council(Opens in a new window) If eventually mass produced, Ooho could go a long way toward reducing this waste.

""The reality is that every day more, when we drink water we throw away a plastic bottle,"" Rodrigo GarcÃ­a GonzÃ¡lez, one of three London-based industrial design students behind the project, told Mashable. ""This act of consumerism reflects the society in which we live. Ooho proposes an alternative.""

Trapped inside two layers of membrane made of brown algae and calcium chloride, water is released from the glob of liquid when its casing is punctured. The membrane can then either be eaten or thrown away, similar to the skin of an apple.

Ooho could be a viable alternative to the plastic water bottle. Credit: Rodrigo GarcÃƒÂ­a GonzÃƒÂ¡lez

Though it's not as sturdy as a water bottle, GarcÃ­a GonzÃ¡lez said a collection of smaller Oohos could be kept in a bigger one with a thicker membrane to prevent unwanted spills (and so that not all of the water has to be consumed in one fell swoop) and its double-membrane design would keep the product hygienic (you could peel back the first one and sip from the second). It may not be the neatest way to hydrate, as seen in this Fast Company(Opens in a new window) video, but according to GarcÃ­a GonzÃ¡lez smaller Oohos will be easier to sip without getting wet.

Credit: RodrÃ­go Garcia GonzÃ¡lez

The container has a creative commons license to encourage innovation and, with the right materials and know-how anyone could, in theory, create one in their own home.

Ooho was inspired by similar cases of membranes found in nature such as egg yolks. The container is assembled using spherification -- a technique that shapes liquid into spheres and roots going back to the 1940s. In an effort to keep the final product as large as possible and to keep the components of the membrane separate, the water is frozen during this process.

WikiPearl(Opens in a new window), a new product sold only in four Massachusetts-based Whole Foods, stretches the limits of packaging using similar methods.

7005503,Pulitzer Awarded to The Guardian and Washington Post for Coverage on Snowden's NSA Leaks,"The Guardian and the Washington Post have been awarded the prestigious Pulitzer Prize for Public Service for their reporting on the NSA surveillance that the leaked documents from Edward Snowden brought to light.

The award recognized Glenn Greenwald, Barton Gellman, Laura Poitras and Ewan MacAskill for their reporting on the topic.

[seealso slug=http://mashable.com/2014/03/18/edward-snowden-ted-2014/]

It has been about 10 months since The Guardian and the Washington Post published stories on the NSA's PRISM program and its widespread data collection, causing privacy concerns in the tech community as well as much of the world. Soon after, Snowden, a former CIA employee and NSA contractor, claimed responsibility for the leaked documents.

Snowden was then charged with espionage and has sought asylum in various countries. He is currently believed to be in Russia. The original reports continue to resonate. President Barack Obama recently proposed an overhaul of the surveillance system.

The reports have been praised as some of the most important journalism work in a generation. Daniel Ellsburg, who leaked a government study of the Vietnam war that later became known as ""the Pentagon Papers,"" said the Snowden documents are the most important leak in the history of the country(Opens in a new window).

"">Snowden released a statement to the Guardian applauding the decision:

Today's decision is a vindication for everyone who believes that the public has a role in government. We owe it to the efforts of the brave reporters and their colleagues who kept working in the face of extraordinary intimidation, including the forced destruction of journalistic materials, the inappropriate use of terrorism laws, and so many other means of pressure to get them to stop what the world now recognises was work of vital public importance.

For all the plaudits the journalists have received, they have also become targets of backlash from both the U.S. and UK government. Peter King, a Republican congressman from New York, called for Greenwald's arrest(Opens in a new window). Heathrow Airport security detained(Opens in a new window) Greenwald's partner, David Miranda, for nine hours. They questioned him and confiscated numerous possessions.

Greenwald and Poitras only recently returned to U.S. soil(Opens in a new window) for the first time since the initial NSA reports when they received the George Polk Award for National Security Reporting on Friday.

""Each one of these awards just provides further vindication that what [Snowden] did in coming forward was absolutely the right thing to do and merits gratitude, and not indictments and decades in prison,"" Greenwald said in regard tot he Polk Award, according to a report from Democracy Now!(Opens in a new window)

""None of us would be here â€¦ without the fact that someone decided to sacrifice their life to make this information available,"" Poitras added. ""And so this award is really for Edward Snowden.""

Journalism is one of the 21 categories recognized by the Pulitzer Prize, founded in 1917 after the death of Joseph Pulitzer and overseen by Columbia University. The Pulitzer is widely considered the greatest honor in journalism, with the public service award regarded as the grand prize.

Greenwald left The Guardian in October to start First Look Media with eBay entrepreneur Pierre Omidyar. Poitras as also joined the company. Greenwald's vertical, The Intercept, went live in February and will continue to explore the documents from Snowden.

7025418,Rodent Robot Sex Helps Scientist Study Evolution,"One scientist has found a way to study 1,000 generations of animals in a matter of days -- using no live creatures and a lot of robot sex.

By using robots the size of rats, Dr. Stefan Elfwing of the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology was able to study evolutionary patterns over thousands of generations without him growing old in the process. In an article published on April 9 in the journal PLOS ONE(Opens in a new window), Elfwing describes how this could provide a way for scientists to gather information about evolution much faster than before.

His study also proves that robots can be used to study animals.

SEE ALSO: Bionic Kangaroo Hops Into the Future of Robotics

Elfwing programmed a colony of small, wheeled bots with the need to forage for batteries that he placed in the vicinity, as well as the need to ""mate."" The robots would obviously produce no offspring, but the desire to mate allowed Elfwing to study how successful mating habits evolve.

Each bot was equipped with a camera so it could locate mates. Sex between bots happened in a very PG way -- a port that uses infrared light to copy their genes(Opens in a new window) when they find a suitable partner. The robots used electrodes in their teeth to recharge once they found a battery.

The conclusion? Chasing after both sex and food is too exhausting. Mating and finding batteries both tired the robots out, according to the study(Opens in a new window), and a successful ""reproduction"" depends on whether two robots have enough energy to, uh, consummate their relationship after their ports line up. This meant that robots had to figure out how to best spend their energy in order to survive and spread their genes.

After 70 experiments, Elfwing found that 75% of the robots turned into what he called ""trackers,"" or robots that actively sought mating partners. The rest turned into ""foragers,""(Opens in a new window) or robots that sought batteries and only happened to mate if their infrared port lined up with another port during their quest for more electricity.

The proportions of these two distinct mating habits are similar to patterns seen in the wild(Opens in a new window), meaning Elfwing's robots seem to be a valid way to study animals.

With that success, Elfwing hopes his robots will help him explore other facets of evolution.

â€œIn this experiment, our robots were hermaphrodites, all robots mate and can produce offspring,"" Elfwing said in the Okinawa institute's article(Opens in a new window).

""In the next stage, we want to see if the robots will take on male and female roles, by taking different risks and costs in reproduction. The behavior exhibited by the two strategies, ""forager"" and ""tracker,"" may be a precursor to the adoption of distinct genders.â€",4/14/2014 0:00,0.401423,15,1,0,4.677165,7,00000,731.5,4648,2508.114,0,0.404773,0.090405,0.03937,0.016732,0,0,438

The Rufus Cuff(Opens in a new window) claims to be a step above the smartwatch because it offers users a connected experience similar to one they would get on a smartphone.

[seealso slug=""smartphone-hacks""]

Aesthetically, it may resemble recently released gadgets such as the Pebble Steel or Samsung's Galaxy Gear, but the device -- which will include a 3-inch screen, and run on Android -- aims to offer more functionality.

""Smartwatches are cool -- a good start to where we should be going -- but this is where we should be,"" Gabe Grifoni, CEO and co-founder of Rufus Labs, the accessory's parent company, told Mashable. ""We are a category beyond the smartwatch.""

Grifoni said he was inspired to create the Rufus Cuff -- named after his dog -- during a four-hour drive home from CES 2013. He remembers loving the wearable technology he saw, but thinking that there was a better way to do it. Simply calling a device ""smart"" doesn't necessarily make it so for Grifoni, who said his longterm goal for the Rufus Cuff is to eventually have it replace our need for smartphones.

Although it won't be able to connect to a cellular network on its own, the Rufus Cuff will be able to send and receive calls or text messages when digitally tethered to a smartphone. Users will also be able to take advantage of its Wi-Fi capabilities. The gadget will be compatible with both Android and iOS devices, although use with the latter will be slightly more limited based on what Apple will allow.

The Rufus Cuff is being marketed as a full-on ""wrist communicator."" Grifoni said the device's large screen will give it an edge over competitors, and claimed it is easy to get used to, especially since the weight of the device is distributed over a larger surface area.

""I have the skinniest, nerdiest wrist in the world, and I built it for myself,"" he said.

7025495,Could Russia Use Cyberwarfare to Further Destabilize Ukraine?,"Eastern Ukraine is full of rioters ready to separate from their nation's government in Kiev -- at least, that's the message the Russian government may want to project to the world. And analysts believe the Kremlin could use cyberattacks to create more chaos and support its objectives.

Protesters in eastern Ukraine have clashed with police and stormed government buildings. A group of separatists who took over a building in Donetsk declared a ""People's Republic of Donetsk"" and demanded a referendum for independence on May 11. In Luhansk, rebels raided an armory and took 56 hostages.

But U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry has accused Russian ""special agents"" of inciting the ruckus. Others claim there's a Russian hand at play behind the curtain of what seems like a looming crisis, manufactured either as pretext for a Russian invasion or as a means to distract from the Kremlin's annexation of Crimea.

Key to all this chaos is a sense of confusion about the state of Ukraine, the theory goes. The Kremlin has led the narrative that there is a widespread separatist movement in the eastern part of the country that the government in Kiev cannot control, and experts think the Russian government could up its game with a subtle cyber strategy.

â€œThe majority of stuff youâ€™re going to see is how can they deny access to information or make sure people donâ€™t know whatâ€™s going on,â€ Ben FitzGerald, director of the technology and national security program at the Center for a New American Security, told Mashable. â€œClearly, the Russians are trying to control a specific narrative.""

That narrative is one in which the Kremlin would invade to protect native Russian speakers, the same reason it gave for invading Crimea.

The Russian government wouldn't necessarily need computerized espionage to support an invasion of eastern Ukraine. All things considered, its takeover of Crimea went off without much of a hitch, and no one reported any electronic assaults that caused lasting damage. Russia's approach to eastern Ukraine might come from precisely the same playbook.

But if Moscow did engage in a significant high-tech assault of any kind, it wouldn't be the first time it has done so.

When Russia invaded neighboring Georgia in 2008, cyberwarfare was a main piece of its strategy. And there, it was true warfare. State-sponsored Russian hackers hit Georgian government websites with distributed denial of service attacks (DDoS) that essentially erased the Georgian government's presence online. It was devastating, but obvious.

""I think those attacks would probably be too overt [this time], and also donâ€™t fit into the Russian narrative of trying to protect Ukraine or protecting Russian-speaking citizens in Ukraine,"" FitzGerald said.

This time, experts say the Russian government would probably be more covert.

Sure, Washington might say Russia is behind any information disruption, but the Kremlin could counter by saying the disarray comes from third-party hackers it can't control, and there's likely no way the U.S. could prove otherwise.

""Attribution is really hard,"" said Jen Weedon, a manager of threat intelligence at FireEye, a global network security company. ""Itâ€™s not as easy as just identifying the origin of where an IP address is."" Later, she added, ""Itâ€™s certainly not an easy task to identify where an attack or an intrusion is coming from without substantial insight.""

And we may have already seen the Russian government testing the cyberwar waters during its takeover of Crimea, even if there were no blatant attacks. A pro-Russian group of Ukrainians known as Cyber Berkut claimed to have disabled the phones of 700 Ukrainian officials(Opens in a new window) in early March, right around when Russia first entered the peninsula, and they took credit for some attacks on government websites as well. There's no evidence(Opens in a new window) this disruption was coordinated by the Russian government, but the Kremlin is also known to outsource its online dirty work(Opens in a new window). Suspicions out of Kiev and the West, along with denials from the Russian government, can lead to a finger-pointing bonanza where facts are hard to decipher.

Even so, analysts say a Moscow-led electronic espionage campaign would have identifiable goals that, if accomplished, could look like the work of more than a band of online outlaws.

For example, a Kremlin-led cyber squad might try to cut off internal Ukrainian government communications so officials there would not be able to coordinate a response to Russian disruption efforts, Weedon said. Officials in Kiev would have difficulty passing information between one another, which might make them seem incompetent. The Russian government could also disrupt lines of communication in eastern Ukraine and mess with television and online news in such a way that eastern Ukrainians are exposed only to information propagated by the Kremlin.

This would all be a part of a strategy that only the Russian government could coordinate, and it would do three things for Moscow. First, it would allow the Kremlin to further the narrative that it wants to protect native Russian speakers. Second, it would prevent the Ukrainian government from countering that narrative with real information. Third, Kiev's inability to respond would make it look weak, disorganized and incapable of assisting an eastern Ukraine that is floundering.

And all this feeds into what experts believe is a larger plan to create a sense of confusion among eastern Ukrainians.

â€œThe fascinating thing I think about this is itâ€™s old-school military doctrine with updated tools,"" FitzGerald said.

That ""old-school"" Kremlin doctrine goes as follows: create chaos, then intervene in a way that makes Russia look like the white knight. Small online and electronic assaults are a means to an end for the Russian government, Weedon said, and its goal is to manipulate public perception in a way that allows it to play the hero.

The situations described above are all plausible, according to experts, but they haven't happened. And even if they did, these experts are quick to point out that this would qualify more as espionage than cyberwar.

It's also important to remember that cyberwar is just that -- it takes place online and electronically and therefore has limitations. An army can only do so much without a physical force to back up its online operation. Russian troops are massed at the eastern Ukrainian border, but they have not crossed that line.

""You could certainly destabilize a state [through cyberwarfare], in terms of causing chaos, targeting critical infrastructure, disrupting communications, spreading false information,"" said Peter Singer, director of the Center for 21st Century Security and Intelligence at the Brookings Institution. ""But thatâ€™s not the same as taking over the state. For that you need physical force on the ground.""",4/14/2014 0:00,0.468439,6,2,0,4.512579,8,Lifestyle,0,5275.363,3303.98,1300,0.509471,0.082593,0.025157,0.018868,0,0,814
7005558,Report: Samsung Galaxy S5 Sales Double S4's Launch-Day Record,"The Samsung Galaxy S5 smartphone just launched on Friday and is already showing a much stronger start than its predecessor, a new report suggests.

Launch-day sales of the Samsung Galaxy S5 smartphone are reportedly double those of the Galaxy S4's launch-day numbers from 2013 in some markets, according to ZDNet Korea(Opens in a new window).

SEE ALSO: Samsung Galaxy S5 Is the Upgrade You Can Skip

In other markets, launch-day sales of the new flagship device were up to 30% higher than launch-day sales of the S4. The S5, which launched in 150 countries, is also reportedly sold out in various global markets.

Although Samsung hasn't confirmed launch-day sales, the report quoted a spokesperson saying the numbers were in the millions. Last year, the Galaxy S4 topped 10 million in sales in one month, marking a new record for Samsung smartphone growth. In comparison, it took the Galaxy S3 smartphone about 50 days to reach the same sales milestone.

The 5.1-inch device has a 1,920 x 1,080 HD display with a quad-core 2.5GHz chip and runs on Android 4.4.2 KitKat. Other bells and whistles include a fingerprint scanner, a heart-rate sensor and a battery-saving mode that can stretch out a few minutes of power over hours.

Samsung has not yet responded to Mashable's request for comment.

The chances of success? Maybe between 30 and 40 percent, said SpaceX(Opens in a new window) vice president of mission assurance Hans Koenigsmann.

""If we can pull this off ... we'll be super-thrilled,"" Koenigsmann told reporters yesterday. You can watch the SpaceX's Dragon launch live on Space.com(Opens in a new window), courtesy of NASA TV. The webcast will begin Monday at 3:45 p.m. EDT.

Ambitious test flight

SpaceX's ambitious reusable rocket test is only a secondary goal for the company today, but if successful it could lead to rocket innovations that may dramatically reduce the cost of space travel. The Hawthorne, Calif.-based company plans to launch its upgraded Falcon 9 rocket into orbit from a pad at Florida's Cape Canaveral Air Force Station at 4:58 p.m. EDT. The main mission: To launch a robotic Dragon space capsule on SpaceX's third delivery flight for NASA(Opens in a new window) as part of a $1.6 billion resupply contract.

But even as SpaceX prepared its Dragon cargo ship for launch, the company was working behind the scenes to take advantage of the flight for its internal reusable rocket program. The Falcon 9 rocket launching Monday has a first stage equipped with four large landing legs, each one of them 25 feet long.

If all goes well, the Falcon 9 rocket's first stage will separate as planned during launch, then perform a long re-entry engine burn to slow its supersonic descent back to Earth. SpaceX officials hope the rocket stage will deploy the legs as it descends and perform a final landing maneuver just over the ocean's surface before toppling over into the water to be retrieved by a recovery team.

""The entire recovery of the first stage is entirely experimental,"" Koenigsmann said. ""It has nothing to do with the primary mission here.""

Monday's mission will mark the third of 12 planned SpaceX Dragon cargo missions to the International Space Station for NASA. SpaceX launched the first flight in 2012, with a second following in 2013.

Last September, SpaceX also successfully demonstrated the ability to relight a Falcon 9 booster's first stage(Opens in a new window) and slow its descent back to Earth. Monday's planned reusable rocket test will attempt to take that demonstration a step further.

""We've been doing improvements to the recovery of the first stage in little steps, being very careful it doesn't affect the performance of Dragon,"" Koenigsmann said.

NASA space station program manager Mike Suffredini told reporters on April 13 that once he was convinced SpaceX's Falcon 9 landing legs posed no threat to Dragon's cargo delivery to the station, he was eager to see how the test would unfold on Monday.

SpaceX's road to reusability

Developing a completely reusable rocket technology(Opens in a new window) has been a long-range goal for SpaceX CEO Elon Musk as a way to reduce the cost of spaceflight. In 2011, Musk unveiled a plan for reusable rockets that envisioned SpaceX booster stages capable of flying back to landing pads on their own, as well as Dragon space capsules with the ability to touch down on land. (SpaceX Dragons currently splash down in the ocean).

Reusable rockets could substantially cut the costs of spaceflight, according to Musk. SpaceX's standard Falcon 9 rocket launches cost between $50 million and $60 million, according to the company's website.

""But the cost of the fuel and oxygen and so forth is only about $200,000,"" Musk said in 2011 when he first unveiled SpaceX's reusable rocket(Opens in a new window) program. ""So obviously, if we can reuse the rocket, say, a thousand times, then that would make the capital cost of the rocket for launch only about $50,000.""

SpaceX is still a ways off from returning a Falcon 9 rocket to a landing pad on dry land. In March, Musk wrote in a Twitter post that the company will aim for water splashdowns until it can master the challenges of returning a rocket booster to Earth safely.

To that end, SpaceX has conducted a series of vertical launch and landing tests of its Grasshopper reusable rocket prototype, sending the prototype rocket on ever-higher flights over the company's proving grounds in McGregor, Texas. Those tests concluded in December.

More test flights planned

On March 28 of this year, SpaceX test fired its first F9R reusable rocket(Opens in a new window), a larger vehicle to continue reusable rocket research where the Grasshopper flights left off. Those test flights will eventually be launched from Spaceport America in New Mexico, SpaceX officials have said.

""The F9R testing program is the next step towards reusability following completion of the Grasshopper program last year,"" SpaceX officials wrote in a video description of the F9R static engine test. ""F9R test flights in New Mexico will allow us to test at higher altitudes than we are permitted for at our test site in Texas, to do more with unpowered guidance and to prove out landing cases that are more-flight like.""

Koenigsmann said SpaceX(Opens in a new window) will take a step-by-step approach to its reusable rocket demonstrations with actual Falcon 9 rockets. While the company aims to make a land landing by the end of 2014, each test will be dependent on the success and lessons from the previous flight.

7003213,Study: 54% of Online Adults Would Spend Tax Refunds on Travel,"If you're getting a tax refund this year, are you planning to use it responsibly or splurge instead?

According to a survey conducted by travel site Hipmunk, 54% of online adults in the United States said if they had to choose one thing, they would spend the money on travel. This contrasts with other surveys on tax refund spending, likely due to the wording of the survey question, which asked people what they would do if they ""could"" spend the money on ""only one thing.""

SEE ALSO: 6 Ways to Get a Bigger Tax Refund

The Hipmunk survey, which polled 4,000 people, also found that 25% of respondents would save their money, 17% would pay down debt and 4% would go shopping.

Asking what people plan to actually do with their refunds gets different results. In its annual survey of 1,000 investors, TD Ameritrade(Opens in a new window) asked how respondents planned to spend the money, assuming they received a refund.

In that survey, 45% of respondents said they would save the money, while only 19% said they would spend their refund on discretionary items, like goods or travel. In 2013, TD Ameritrade's survey found similar results(Opens in a new window), with 47% saying they would save their money.

While saving money may be more responsible, it isn't very fun. This explains the discrepancy between what people want to do and what they feel obliged to do.

6864201,The UN Climate Report: What You Need to Know,"On Sunday, the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released the final installment of a massive report laying out just how feasible it is for the global community to limit manmade global warming to below dangerous levels.

Like the previous two installments, published in September of last year and March, this report contains extremely dense, technical material.

Yet its contents are hugely important for the public and policymakers. It lays out the case for why drastic emissions cuts are needed, starting within the next decade, in order to have a decent chance of limiting the amount -- and the pace -- of global warming.

First, here's the good news from the report. Meeting the target of keeping global warming to less than 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit above preindustrial levels can be done -- if we take action now.

Here's a breakdown of some of the latest report's most important findings.

The window of opportunity to avert a ""dangerous"" amount of global warming is rapidly closing: We have just about a decade left to bend the upward curve of greenhouse gas emissions. Attempts to reduce emissions significantly so far have not succeeded.

Pathways of global GHG emissions (GtCO2eq/yr) in baseline and mitigation scenarios for different long-term concentration levels. Credit:

#IPCC(Opens in a new window) : â€œClear message from science: To avoid dangerous interference with climate system, we need to move away from business as usual.â€â€” WMO | OMM (@WMOnews) April 14, 2014(Opens in a new window)

The longer we wait, the fewer options we will have: After 2030, for example, many of the more than 1,000 policy scenarios the scientists examined would not succeed in limiting manmade global warming to 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit or less, which is the goal that world leaders agreed to(Opens in a new window) during the Copenhagen climate summit in 2009. In other words, the world will have fewer options available the longer we wait to cut emissions.

We're definitely on the wrong track: The world is on course to see an increase in global average surface temperatures of up to 9 degrees Fahrenheit by the end of this century. This could have disastrous consequences by dramatically raising global sea levels, melting land-based ice sheets, and leading to more heat waves and extreme precipitation events, among other impacts.

We are already seeing climate change impacts worldwide, including the increased likelihood and severity of some extreme weather events like heat waves and heavy precipitation events, and the global average surface temperature has increased by just 1.6 degrees Fahrenheit since 1901.

#IPCC(Opens in a new window) #climatesolutions(Opens in a new window) press conf -- emissions have grown over past decade despite mitigation efforts and economic crisis.â€” IPCC (@IPCC_CH) April 13, 2014(Opens in a new window)

We already have most of the technologies we need: We don't need to -- in fact we shouldn't -- wait for some miracle technological solution to climate change, since tools to burn energy more cleanly and use energy more efficiently already exist. However, in most climate scenarios, carbon capture and storage technology needs to be employed to bring emissions to lower levels. Such technology, which would capture carbon dioxide emissions before it escapes a power plant and bury it deep underground, is not yet proven on a commercial scale.

Emisions cuts may not break the bank: Although economic studies of how much it will cost to minimize global warming vary, but the study says that aggressive emissions cuts would only shave off between 0.04% and 0.14% from consumption growth during the century.

Emissions need to trend in the opposite direction, ASAP: Total manmade greenhouse-gas emissions were the highest in human history from 2000 to 2010, and reached 49 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent per year in 2010. The vast majority of that, or about 78%, has come from burning fossil fuels for energy, with smaller amounts coming from deforestation, agriculture and other sources.

To have a good chance of limiting warming to less than 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit compared to pre-industrial levels, carbon-dioxide levels would have to be kept below 450 parts per million (ppm) by 2100. (They are currently just above 400 ppm.)

This would require emissions cuts of 40% to 70% by 2050, and near zero emissions by 2100. Accomplishing this without paying an exorbitant cost would require that actions begin within the next decade.

Coal is reversing energy sector gains: While coal use is plummeting in the U.S., the increased use of coal in developing countries (much of it shipped from the U.S.) as a cheap source of electricity has reversed trends toward a progressively less carbon intensive energy sector.

Business as usual is not climate as usual: Atmospheric carbon-dioxide levels are currently just above 400 parts per million (ppm), and are already the highest in at least the past 800,000 years. Under a business as usual scenario, the report says carbon can be expected to soar to higher than 1,300 ppm by 2100. This could lead to global warming ranging from 4.5 degrees Fahrenheit to 14 degrees Fahrenheit above pre-industrial levels by the end of this century, when the full range of scientific uncertainty is taken into account.

Total manmade greenhouse gas emissions (GtCO2eq/yr) by economic sectors. The emissions data from Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU) includes land-based CO2 emissions from forest fires, peat fires and peat decay. Credit:

We're on a CO2 binge: About half of all cumulative manmade carbon-dioxide emissions between 1750 and 2010 happened during the past 40 years. Since carbon dioxide remains in the atmosphere for as many as 1,000 years, the cumulative emissions are what determines how much warming weâ€™re ultimately in store for -- and weâ€™ve already burned about half of the carbon budget that would keep warming to less than 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit.

If those in favor of acting to limit climate change feel vindicated by the report, that's not the same as feeling optimistic. Preventing dangerous climate change may be technically feasible, but the political will to take the hard and necessary decisions -- by the time we have to take them -- still seems to be lacking.",4/14/2014 0:00,0.736486,2,1,0,4.417219,4,Entertainment,2451.5,4143.063,3364.998,716,0.240565,-0.08533,0.019868,0.039735,0.1875,-0.125,1100

7025254,5 Virtual Assistants That Are More Productive Than Siri,"Siri, Apple's sometimes snarky virtual assistant, is supposed to be able to help you streamline appointments by knowing where you are supposed to be and when. While I've found Siri can be useful for this, I've discovered several alternatives that have their own advantages.

There are several third-party apps that are stronger for personal productivity and organization, especially given that much of what Siri performs is pretty consumer-focused. Here are some choices that will prove to be a good virtual assistant for the day-to-day business user.

Speaktoit Assistant

This app offers much that you would find in a service like Siri - talk to it and it will perform actions. You can dictate an iMessage, open web site, create calendar entries, and a myriad of other tasks.

It has a somewhat funky interface with a cartoonish avatar that serves as your assistant. But beyond that it is rather useful, especially given that it powers email, calendars, maps and other productivity-oriented apps. The developer says support for additional services is in the works.

Google Now

Google's search app includes its competitor to Siri: Google Now. If your company uses a Google Apps account connecting it to Google Now is tremendously useful as it pulls in a list of calendar appointments or can perform reminders through its card interface.

What makes this even more appealing is that Google Now works across iOS, Android, and the Chrome browser. So if you use an iPad but have an Android phone your connection to important events remains.

Calendars 5

The newest calendar from Readdle isn't just for finding the date - it is a full-fledged task manager and organizer. One signature feature is its support for ""natural language."" You can type ""Meet Susan in her office at 2:00"" and it will create an event, which is much faster than tapping through a menu to create an event.

It also offers the day's agenda in a very user-friendly setup, making it easy to glance at what awaits.

Meeting Assistant

Meeting Assistant is great for business users because it is specifically built for the purpose of organizing notes, contact information, and other essential details for running from one meeting to another.

The interface is built like a retro binder, but it has many powerful features like keeping calendar invites accessible, notetaking and connecting contact data with social networks.

Mynd

While not yet optimized for iPad, Mynd certainly can be used on the iPad as well as the iPhone - which the current version is designed for. Mynd makes the list given its interface that makes it easy to discover the content surrounding your day. It creates an attractive, tile-based setup of upcoming appointments, weather, time and news.

Mynd says it will learn your habits and provide contextual information, such as suggesting to space out appointments based on travel time or assigning meetings to specific locations that you frequent.",4/14/2014 0:00,0.565789,9,1,1,5.077586,7,00000,0,3609.718,1997.826,9200,0.316667,0.063542,0.025862,0.00431,0,0,1700
7005238,When to Watch Monday's Total Lunar Eclipse,"Looking for information about the August 21, 2017, Solar Eclipse? Click here!

Tonight the moon will turn red and if youâ€™re in virtually any place in the Western hemisphere â€“- and you can stay awake -- you should be able to see it.

This extraordinary celestial show is, in fact, a product of a relatively rare full-lunar eclipse. The Earth, moon and sun will be in alignment for a few hours on April 15 (early Tuesday morning), so that our blue orbâ€™s shadow will pass over the moon. Light from the sun will scatter through the earthâ€™s atmosphere and illuminate the moon (NASA describes it as a â€œall the sunsets on Earth, projected onto the Moonâ€), resulting in the moonâ€™s temporary â€œredâ€ appearance. The so-called â€œBlood Moonâ€ will more likely be a lovely shade of rose.

Itâ€™s an exciting astronomical event, but figuring out when you need to look up (if youâ€™re up) can be a bit of a trick, especially if you use one of the various and confusing time tables presented online. We, like you, are a little lazy about doing the math between time zones. So we present a set of time-zone maps that tell you exactly when, in your area, you should be scanning the sky to get the best view. And when you do that lunar gazing, be sure to look somewhat due west to catch the moon as it moves across the sky, heading to the western horizon, where it will set.

[seealso slug=""space-photos-satellite""]

NASAâ€™s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO), which has been flying around the moon and collecting images and data for five years, will have the best seat in the house for the whole event. Unfortunately, since the Earth will be blocking the sun, the LRO will not be getting its usual solar charge. As a result, NASA will put it in a low-power phase for the duration of the eclipse and the LRO will not be making any scientific observations during the eclipse.

â€œItâ€™s the longest time the spacecraft will be in darkness, shadow and cold, so weâ€™re being very, very cautious,â€ said NASA Goddard Space Flight Center Research Scientist Noah Petro. NASA plans on heating the LRO up prior to the eclipse and then monitoring it very closely throughout. However, the odds of something catastrophic happening to the LRO are, Petro said, â€œexceptionally low.â€

A NASA spacecraft thatâ€™s unlikely to survive the total lunar eclipse is LADEE (Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer). Itâ€™s set to crash into the moon, as planned, either during or soon after the eclipse.

If cloud cover makes ruins your chances of watching the eclipse, NASA will be live streaming unobscured telescope views(Opens in a new window) throughout the night.

Donâ€™t feel too badly if you do miss this lunar eclipse. NASAâ€™s Petro said weâ€™re in the midst of â€œtetrad,â€ or four total eclipses in a row. After Tuesday morning, thereâ€™ll be one in October, then two more in 2015.

7005337,Windows Phone 8.1 Review: Cortana Leads a Feature-Packed Update,"Windows Phone has come a long way. Microsoft's phone platform has enjoyed a lot of critical success over the past few years, but the praise was mostly for things like design, cool tricks like live tiles, and the fact that it's not made by Apple or Google.

Even when Windows Phone received kudos, it was usually in an ""attaboy"" kind of way -- a backhanded compliment that subtly hinted the truth: that for all its pizzazz, the operating system was, in some ways, months or even years behind its chief competitors, iOS and Android.

[seealso slug=""microsoft-2013-milestones""]

No longer. With Windows Phone 8.1 -- which gets distributed to developers today, with the first handsets coming in a couple of weeks -- the software on Windows handsets has caught up with its rivals. In a few use cases, Microsoft even offers a better experience.

The condition of Windows Phone's app catalog remains a big asterisk, though. Many popular iOS and Android apps don't have a Windows Phone version, and some of those that have taken the leap don't offer all the features of their counterparts.

Nonetheless, users and developers can approach that platform with a new confidence. Windows Phone 8.1 delivers the great user experience the platform is known for, but with far fewer, ""Man, this phone would be great if only it couldâ€¦"" moments than previous generations.

The upgrades in Windows Phone 8.1 generally fall into three main buckets: new features, better personalization, and Cortana, the platform's newborn virtual assistant.

Cortana

The most scene-stealing new feature in Windows Phone 8.1 is Cortana, a voice-powered virtual assistant named after Master Chief's holographic helper in the Halo video games. While functionally similar to Apple's Siri, Cortana is more than just voice: her goal is to serve you better by learning from your behavior, anticipating your needs and offering you information when it makes sense.

Credit: Microsoft

She does this by examining not just how you use your phone, but also with hooks into your personal information like your Bing and Facebook profiles (all opt-in, of course). Because anything that has access to our Bing history would really know a lot about us, right?

In all seriousness, it's a great idea, but one that takes time to really work. In my brief time with Cortana, I didn't get so much as a hint of her ""anticipatory"" abilities, although I look forward to the birthday gift suggestions for my brother come July.

I did, however, get a sense of Cortana's ability to learn. The first time I asked Cortana to text my wife, her contact card popped up along with every person in my address book who shared her first name. After I told her the correct one, on every subsequent command -- whether it was a text or something else -- all I had to do was say her first name, and Cortana knew who I was talking about.

That was great, but Cortana doesn't always get the hint. After pinning Mashable to my phone's home screen, I asked her to ""Launch Mashable."" Dutifully, Cortana asked whether I wanted to open the website or my Mashable Email account. I told her the site. And I did so the next 12 times I uttered the same command, but she never figured out to just stop asking and go right to the site.

This problem gets worse if the app in question lets you pin things to the Start screen. Evernote, for example, lets you pin individual notes to Start, so every time I asked Cortana to launch Evernote, she asked me which one. One was the actual app, another my To-Do list. But Cortana saw them both as the app, with the same name.

Credit: Microsoft

Cortana was fantastic at performing typical voice-assistant stuff like creating calendar appointments, emailing contacts and setting reminders. I particularly liked the People Reminders -- where you can attach a reminder to a specific contact, rather than a time or place (""remind me to tell Andrea I have two tickets to Rocky next time I talk to her"").

Cortana also negates the need to download Shazam since she can listen for music and tell you what's playing just as well. She'll even save your search to refer to it later.

After spending some quality time with Cortana, I'm intrigued. I definitely get the sense that she's more capable than Siri, but it's hard to say how much is mere potential at this point. I'd love to see her integrated into more parts of the experience -- I find it odd that she can't search the Windows Phone Store, for example.

I want to believe Cortana might, after months of continual use, evolve into an indispensable tool. The framework is there, but based on what I saw that's going to take some retraining.

Personalization

In iOS 6, Apple introduced a VIP list feature so users can designate contacts that matter the most to them. Windows Phone now has the same functionality with Inner Circle -- a list of people who will be able to reach you even if you've set the phone to ""Quiet Hours,"" another new feature that's similar to Do Not Disturb in iOS.

Microsoft hasn't just learned some feature tricks from Apple, though. With version 8.1, Windows Phone adds iCloud to its list of compatible accounts -- something even Android phones usually don't offer. Now, if you have family members or important contacts on iOS, your Windows Phone will be able to integrate things like Calendars seamlessly.

The Calendar app itself is upgraded as well. When you're in the Week view, tapping on a day expands it with some pretty nifty animation. Tapping the day's header or the back button takes you back to the Week view. Microsoft's really outdone itself with the UI -- it's much better than iPhone or anything on Android.

Credit: Microsoft

One of my favorite aesthetic upgrades in version 8.1 is the Start screen background image. When you first set up your Windows Phone, you usually pick a theme color, which then dominates the Start screen's live tiles that don't have their own color.

Now, instead of a color, you can choose for those tiles to all share the same image. As you scroll up and down your start screen, the image doesn't move as fast as the scoll, so the tiles feel like a window to the picture in the background. Trust me, the effect is pretty cool.

Credit: Microsoft

New features

One of the biggest holes in Windows Phone's feature lineup was some kind of notification center. The software could handle push notifications, of course; it just didn't have a central hub for them. Now it's got one in the form of Action Center, which you access by sliding from the top of the Start screen.

Besides providing a place to see your most recent notifications, Action Center also includes some quick settings. There are controls for Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, airplane mode and screen rotation lock, but those are just the defaults. You can substitute whatever settings you wish for the four buttons -- a nice touch of customization.

Credit: Microsoft

Action Center is well thought-out. For instance, when you dismiss one of the notifications by swiping right, the app's live tile reflects the change. After all, if I've already seen the email here, I don't need the tile screaming at me to check back. That's very logical, and something I'd like to see iOS get better at.

Microsoft changed the built-in onscreen keyboard in Windows Phone 8.1 to a ""Word Flow Keyboard"" -- which is essentially Swype. The idea is you input text by swiping through letters without actually tapping the screen. You still can, but since you don't need to lift fingers anymore, you may be able to save some time.

I've never been that good with Swype, so I was skeptical of new feature, but I found that the big-key design of Windows Phone's keyboard makes all the difference. While I was often unsure of what to do with my other hand, the Word Flow keyboard was great for dashing off short notes quickly. You need a couple of days to get confident with it, but once you do you'll wish it was there on every phone you use.

Credit: Microsoft

There are a host of other minor upgrades, including the ability to upgrade a voice call to a Skype call, VPN support and a reading mode in Internet Explorer 11, but the best one may be Wi-Fi Sense. This feature lets you skip any agreement screens when joining public Wi-Fi networks (which can sometimes interfere with access). Even better, you'll be able to share network access to any contact, without sharing a network's password. The downside: said contact needs to be using Wi-Fi Sense, too.

Going to 8.1

Windows Phone 8.1 isn't just another software update. With it, the platform is technologically closer to its rivals than its ever been (although some deficits, like Bluetooth Low Energy support, are still nagging). With Cortana, Microsoft is even venturing into parts unknown in the hope of creating something really forward-looking.

For today, though, Windows Phone 8.1 is a phenomenal smartphone experience -- in many ways superior to iOS and Android. It's a shame, then, that the ecosystem is still challenged with issues surrounding app selection and app quality. Instagram on Windows Phone, for example, is a shadow of its iPhone version.",4/14/2014 0:00,0.57563,6,2,0,4.855967,10,Tech,0,3621.892,2828.451,4900,0.324134,0.140693,0.032922,0.004115,0,0,1900

6785635,"The Rise and Fall of AIM, the Breakthrough AOL Never Wanted","When we think about the spectacular collapses of once untouchable Internet properties, companies like MySpace and Pets.com come to mind. The rise and fall of AOL Instant Messenger rivals them all. Once the dominant force in digital messaging and a source of innovations other companies spun off into billions of dollars of businesses, AIM is now mostly dormant. Mashable sat down with three of the early engineers of the program to learn about its origins, why AOL never quite embraced the concept of a free messaging service, getting hacked by Microsoft and the features that never quite made it to users.

The 1990s belonged to America Online.

It had risen above competitors in Prodigy and CompuServe to become the dominant Internet service provider for American households. Millions of subscribers paid AOL monthly for the ability to sign online. Its disks could be found almost anywhere. The ""You've got mail"" notification became the sound Americans associated with their first email accounts, as well as a movie with Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan.

[seealso slug=http://mashable.com/2014/04/09/pulling-messenger-facebook-mobile-terrible/]

Barry Appelman, Eric Bosco and Jerry Harris worked at AOL in the 1990s and early 2000s as engineers on AOL Instant Messenger, known commonly as AIM. They weren't hired to build a messenger. Appelman and Bosco programmed in the Unix operating system. Harris had been a programmer at a small web browser company purchased by AOL.

But together with a group of other engineers they helped take AIM from inception to dominance, then watched it fall into dormancy, unable to convince AOL management that free was the future.

Sitting with them and talking about the program, they exude pride for what they built and how it impacted the Internet. That pride is accompanied by a sense of ""what if?""

During our conversation, the term ""innovator's dilemma"" is thrown around a few times.

Harvard Business School Professor Clayton Christensen coined the term, which is the title of his renowned book(Opens in a new window). The concept is simple -- companies concerned with its current products, profits and customers often fail to recognize and adapt to change even from within.

Whatsapp is not far from their minds. That comes up a couple times as well. The app, which Facebook bought for $16 billion, is essentially what they worked on in the mid 90s -- messaging over the Internet.

AOL is still pivoting away from its days as an ISP. Under the leadership of Tim Armstrong it now focuses on video and its ad network. In another life, before a disastrous acquisition of Time Warner, it brought the Internet into the homes of Americans and controlled the program that popularized online messaging without ever really meaning to.

It would be easier to call AIM ahead of its time if it had not become so wildly popular almost immediately after its launch. In many ways, AIM was right in line with the times, just at a company hanging on to a business model that would soon become obsolete.

The Buddy List

The seeds of AIM began within AOL and the mind of Barry Appelman.

Appelman joined after his time at IBM, where he worked on some of the first standards to connect computers over the Internet (through what are known as Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol or TCP/IP).

Before building a messaging program for the Internet, he created something else that would eventually spawn AIM. Necessity, being the mother of invention, helped lead to what is now a near given on the web -- the buddy list.

Appelman remembers it was November 1994. AOL still charged an hourly fee to be logged onto its service.

With most systems of that era, an administrator might be able to tell people were logged on, but they didn't know who.

""They didn't have any central presence information,"" Appelman said. ""They didn't know anything about [the users].""

Not so for AOL. Due to the way its system was constructed, AOL knew not just that people were logged on but which users they were. This allowed for the construction of a location tool that proved extremely popular.

At first, AOL users who logged on were not greeted with a list of fellow friends online. But AOL did have a manual way to search for said friends, if you knew their exact screennames. This function became so overrun with requests that its servers often crashed.

Appelman reasoned that instead of having to ask, the program might as well tell you if your friends were online. Patent US 6750881 B1(Opens in a new window) ""User definable on-line co-user lists"" was born, a.k.a, the buddy list.

""It was an ease of use improvement. You didn't have to check whether somebody was on, but it told you,"" Appelman said.

Far from a giant development product, Appelman discussed it with only his close colleagues, as AOL did not have a great amount of oversight at the time.

""Buddy list was done without telling anybody, because we didn't have any product management then. So I just decided to do it,"" Appelman said.

""They wanted to kill it.""

Eric Bosco joined AOL in August 1996. Two months later, AOL would switch from an hourly rate to a flat fee. People could suddenly spend as long as they liked online. AOLâ€™s infrastructure had trouble handling the transition.

""Every single server in production was crashing because of the load,"" Bosco said.

Bosco bugged his boss to put him on a project. He joined a team that, unbeknownst to AOL executives, had begun to explore the idea of a messenger that existed beyond the ""garden walls"" of AOL.

""A small group of us, basically four, spent three weeks in a room trying to design what the system would look like,"" Bosco (below) said.

Credit:

AOL had become a behemoth in the early days of the consumer Internet. It handled around 180,000 simultaneous connections. Bosco said the goals for AOL's messenger were set much higher: 5 million simultaneous users. Even that number would eventually be much too small.

That requirement meant AOL's messenger would need its own code, particularly as the resources allotted to the project -- technically none -- would have trouble with that scale. AIM was being developed without any approval from AOL executives.

But if AIM was to be a standalone program, it needed to run off some equipment.

""AIM was sort of the prototypical skunkworks project,"" Bosco said. â€œSince it was an unsanctioned project, one of the problems we had was you need to run servers in the data centers.â€

Appelman called in a favor to the head of AOL's data centers, who happened to have some old Hewlett-Packard servers he'd planned to ship back to HP. He agreed to ""lose"" the machines so the AIM team could use them in an unofficial capacity.

""So during the day I was writing code and at night I was configuring the servers,"" Bosco said.

When the program was finally shown to AOL, management was not pleased. Offering a piece of AOL's system for free to everyone went against the company's entire subscription-based model.

""They wanted to kill it and at some point they wanted to fire me for doing this stunt,"" Appelman said.

Appelman credits a particularly strong push from the product team for final approval to launch the product.

Talk is cheap.

AIM's launch saw zero fanfare. The engineers and product team had to fight against executives who recognized no value -- perhaps even a losing proposition -- in offering a free program.

AIM was unceremoniously put on one of the company's file transfer protocols (FTP), a common way for files to be moved from one computer to another over the Internet. While public, AOL's FTP was not meant to be a consumer-facing platform. But AOL's popularity had made its FTPs closely watched among those in the know.

""AOL was the core of the consumer Internet, and every hacker in the world was trying to bring AOL down, so they knew all of our FTP server addresses,"" Bosco said.

Without even a webpage from which to download AIM, the program spread rapidly.

""The very first night of the release of AIM, we put the binary executable on the FTP server ... That night we got 900 simultaneous users,"" Bosco said.

""People found it. People located it. People spread the word,"" Harris (below) said. ""People would camp on that FTP server waiting for the update,"" which came weekly.

Early success did little to convince AOL management that a free product was of any good to the company. Bosco, who was eventually promoted to a management position and still worked on AIM, had to fight to keep it afloat.

""My biggest job as a manager was to keep AIM alive internally, because every single executive vice president wanted to shut it down and kill it. They could not understand the concept of giving away for free something that was of real value to the paying subscriber base,"" Bosco said. ""It was always AIM versus AOL. They hated us.""

AOL might have had its issues with AIM, but that did little to hamper the program's rapid growth. One particular use case the engineers identified was in workplaces.

""AOL was 100% a consumer-focused company, and we realized early on that one of the main constituents of people that was going to use AIM was going to be consumers in the workplace,"" Bosco said. ""And most likely the workplace would not be amused.""

Some clever programming within AIM made the program the bane of IT departments. One feature automatically probed for a way to connect if its primary port was blocked; AIM would run through all the available ports until it found one that was not.

This made AIM extremely hard for companies to thwart.

Bosco recounted a call during which the head of IT of a major investment bank screamed at him. The administrator had tried to block AIM, but the program had eventually hopped around until it had attached to something the company couldn't risk interrupting: the port that synchronized time across the entire company's computer system.

""His only choice to block us was to un-synchronize time on all of his computers,"" Bosco said. ""The admins had no clue how to block us. We were like malware from their point of view.""

The program blossomed, drawing as many as 18 million simultaneous users. Professionals flocked to it.

""AIM became how all Wall Street communicated,"" Appelman said.

AIM high.

AIM quickly became the dominant messaging program of the late 1990s and early 2000s.

AOL bought another messaging company, Mirabilis, which operated ICQ, another popular messenger. The popularity of messaging meant other companies began to approach AOL about a way to tap into AIM. Apple's first iteration of iChat was powered by AIM. Microsoft also got in the game with MSN messenger. While it found a solid user base overseas, it lagged AOL(Opens in a new window) in attracting U.S. users.

Microsoft wanted to ensure its MSN program at least allowed for contact with AIM users. Thus, MSN Messenger launched with the ability to chat with AIM accounts(Opens in a new window).

This meant war.

""We were not amused,"" Bosco said. ""So we were like, 'Well, we've got to try blocking them so they can't do this.'""

Any time another messenger connected with AIM's network, it was required to provide a version type. MSN Messenger identified itself as ""MSN Messenger Version 1.0,"" Bosco said. So they tweaked AIM's system to cut the connection any time this version tried to connect.

Microsoft countered. It released an update to its MSN Messenger program that self-identified as AIM.

AOL blocked the attempt again.

After 21 more Microsoft updates that attempted to connect to AIM, AOL threatened to introduce malicious code into MSN's system. Checkmate.

AOL had triumphed.

Microsoft eventually signed a deal with Yahoo(Opens in a new window) to connect messaging networks.

The features

AIM was originally designed to exist entirely apart from AOL, but early on in the development process the engineers realized it would need to be able to communicate inside AOL's program as well. AIM became a bridge between the so-called ""walled garden"" and the wider Internet.

That garden provided AOL users with a buffer. AOL was able to control much of what its users saw and was intentionally designed to be family- and particularly child-friendly. AIM was a window outside the walls, where AOL had no control.

This tension between what AOL could control and AIM's breach of that security haunted the project from the early days, and led to the creation -- and suppression -- of some of the program's most innovative features.

One of the first was the warning feature, Harris said.

""In order to allow [messaging with AOL users] to happen, we had to develop a feature,"" he said. ""We had to allow people on both AOL and AIM to warn somebody, and if you warn somebody a number of times, the connection got slower and slower until they were cut off for a certain amount of time.""

Like with any part of AIM, the warning feature became a battle between the engineers and the rest of AOL.

""The warning feature internally was called 'electronic vilification,' and we wanted to label the button 'evil,'"" Bosco said. ""The AOL corporate marketing team absolutely refused to let us label the button 'evil.'""

Other features evolved as the engineers sought to solve shortcomings they'd encountered while using the program. Bosco recounted times he would message a coworker with an urgent question and wait for a reply. Was the person there and just not answering? Had he stepped away? When would he be back?

Enter the away message.

""It was almost a corporate need,"" Bosco said.

With no shortage of feature ideas and a history of operating below the radar, the engineers at AOL often updated AIM without going through the company's bureaucracy, though.

Buddy icons? Launched without approval, Harris said.

""If we could sneak stuff in without telling the product people, it would get in,"" Appelman said.

The AIM profile, which eventually grew to include a variety of its own features, came out of the fact that the AIM website was out of the control of the engineers. They had no say in what went on the page, which they recount was usually a big ""download"" button.

They had ideas to make it a social landing page for its users, where people could have a profile, access message boards and generally drive AIM's popularity back to the web. That idea was roundly rejected.

""The only recourse we had was to bake some of the functionality into the client itself,"" Bosco said. ""It would have made a lot more sense to put your profile on a webpage, rather than a client that nobody else could see, but we were not allowed to do it.""

Credit:

AIM added elements that appeared years ahead of other companies. It rolled out voice chat before Skype. It added file transfer. It launched chat bots people could interact with, as well as a stock ticker and a news ticker.

The engineers also began exploring the mobile space just as text messaging was beginning to catch on. AIM introduced the ability to chat with mobile phones.

But with AIM bringing essentially zero revenue and costing money to operate, AOL did little to encourage the exploration of the features and outright blocked others.

Numerous ideas never made it past the development phase. The engineers explored ways to broaden AIM's user base, creating versions for set-top boxes and PlayStation 2 that were never released. AOL squashed those, Appelman said.

Another feature that never made it to users was internally known as ""Aimster."" After Napster took off, AOLâ€™s engineers figured out a way to make a userâ€™s files searchable. A buddy could check out the files of a friend and select ones to transfer. It was not as functional as Napster, but AIM had many more users.

""We thought with our network it would spread like wildfire,"" he said.

By that time, AOL had merged with Time Warner, which was not a fan of Napster. AOL killed the feature.

Ghosttown, USA

Despite the wild success of AIM and the innovations it spawned, AOL kept it at armâ€™s length.

AOL, at the time, was a subscription business intent on maintaining its revenue as an Internet service provider. It did not help that attempts to monetize AIM were unsuccessful.

Bosco worked on putting ads into the program. Despite a variety of tricks to increase the impact of its ad space -- including determining when a person stopped typing so the ad could change with maximum impact -- advertisers never bought in. AIM was not compatible with DoubleClick, the dominant ad management service of the time.

Despite the effort, Bosco said they never sold a dollar of ad space and instead just ran AOL promos. To a subscription business, a free program that could not be monetized was worthless. AOL was not about to change its entire business model for AIM.

""AIM was never really embraced by AOL because of the innovator's dilemma, what I call the cash cow dilemma,"" Appelman said.

AIM did eventually begin to bring in money, but not in significant amounts. Its grip on the messaging market had loosened, and the rise of social networking sites with proprietary chat functions made it less relevant.

The program had also begun to lag behind other services. AOL shunned outside developers that wanted to create their own features for AIM. Its own innovations had helped keep it on the cutting edge, but it began to fall behind as other services opened up.

AOL's resistance was palpable when Bosco and some colleagues released an open-source messenger for Linux. The company was furious.

""AOL was very much anti-open source,"" Bosco said.

With AIM's popularity waning, the operation's staff, which had ballooned to around 100 at its peak, was repeatedly cut back. Layoffs started in 2002 and continued yearly through 2005. In 2012, a round of layoffs left the program with only support staff.

Bosco, Harris and Appelman have moved into advertising at ChoiceStream(Opens in a new window), which works on highly targeted programmatic marketing campaigns.

AIM still functions, the way a ghost town silently weathers on. AOL declined to provide numbers on active users for this story, but a 2011 report said AIM held a 0.7% share(Opens in a new window) of the world messenger market.

AOL is doing reasonably well despite the missed opportunities. It is now the leading video ad server(Opens in a new window) on the web and is working to compete with major players on Internet advertising.

Looking back, Appelman, Bosco and Harris each voiced his own sense of ""what if?"" but ultimately acknowledged AIM came to fruition in the wrong company at the right time.

""If AOL had 20/20 hindsight, maybe the story would have had a different ending,"" Appelman said. ""They couldn't make that leap where they turned the business upside down ... Companies generally don't do that trick.""",4/15/2014 0:00,0.43985,58,6,1,5.206349,7,00000,2200.658,3609.718,2606.603,71500,0.51362,0.185671,0.028219,0.003527,0.9,0.9,10500

This is classic data mining at work. Even if each scale purchaser only made one other drug-related purchase, when you look at the clusters, the pattern becomes obvious.

Amazon clearly did not set out to create such a field-tested kit for starting an illicit business. But looking at the list of items, it sure seems like they've created a group of products by looking at the purchasing habits of people who may not be recording all of their incomes on W-2s and 1099s. Not everyone who buys one of these scales is a drug dealer, but... it sure seems popular among a demographic in need of baggies.

So, how long until police departments find an AWS-100 scale and request account information from Amazon?

The Bluefin-21(Opens in a new window), an autonomous underwater vehicle, was deployed from the Australian navy ship Ocean Shield early Monday. However, the submersible turned back six hours into its mission to explore the search zone in the southern Indian Ocean, off the coast of Western Australia, because it exceeded its maximum depth of around 15,000 feet, according to a release from the Joint Agency Coordination Centre(Opens in a new window). The six hours of collected data is currently being ""extracted and analyzed.""

The Bluefin-21, which has a built-in safety feature that causes it to resurface, will redeploy later on Tuesday when weather conditions are favorable, said the JACC, an organization established by the Australian government to coordinate the search for Flight 370.

Search-and-rescue teams have not been able to detect electronic signals from Flight 370's black boxes since April 8, so the Bluefin-21 was tasked with exploring the underwater search zone -- which measures 500 square miles -- in the area of the detected signals. Battery-operated acoustic beacons attached to the black boxes were designed to send out signals for around 30 days after entering the water.

Monday's mission was the Bluefin-21's first, and originally aimed to cover an area of 15 square miles. Each mission will take at least 24 hours to complete, according to the JACC(Opens in a new window): The submersible takes two hours to get to the bottom of the ocean, 16 hours to search, two hours to resurface and four hours to download and analyze the data collected.

The well-known saying 'Boston Strong' could be seen everywhere, from banners and signs to t-shirts and storefronts. The anniversary drew a stream of onlookers, from tourists who wanted to lend their support, to last yearâ€™s runners who had returned to remember, some wearing the bright blue and yellow marathon jackets that became a symbol of solidarity.

Walking down Boylston Street, crowds of hundreds of people huddled together under umbrellas while the rain poured down. At 2:49 p.m. ET, the time the first bomb exploded, there was a moment of silence. Nothing could be heard except the gentle sound of rain falling on umbrellas and, soon after, the strong and supportive sound of bagpipes. The mood was somber, yet uplifting, while the victims of the bombings were remembered, as well as the courage and compassion of those who ran toward danger to help, rather than away.

7005088,"In Boston, Terror Will Never Destroy a Runner's High","When I ran my first Boston Marathon in 2009, I was stunned by the aura. Most marathon crowds pack a part of the course and disappear for the out-of-the-way stretches, but the Boston crowd was at least three-deep nearly the entire time. Everyone picked out something about the runners' outfits -- your singlet, the color of your shorts -- and shouted words of encouragement. Drunk college kids from every school in the city lined the course and hollered as only drunk college kids can.

It's hard to forget that kind of uproarious positivity. Thatâ€™s why the Boston Marathon is so special. An optimism normally derided as hokey or fake is open and encouraged there. For many, that marathon is the culmination of an achievement that took years to build to, which contributed to why last year's bombing at the finish line that injured at least 260(Opens in a new window) and killed three was so vile. Lives were ended and shattered, and it felt like the two suspected bombers had totally marred the positivity on which the Boston Marathon thrives.

During that 2009 race, it was amazing that there could be such a raucous party for a running event, and it wasnâ€™t until years later that I realized the crowd knew something I didnâ€™t: Completing a marathon is worth celebrating.

People start running for all sorts of reasons. Sometimes, each step provides a modicum of control in an otherwise hectic life.

Other times, itâ€™s the easiest way a person knows to lose weight. Maybe itâ€™s just simply that for as long as someone is running, he's removed from his phone and email.

But every catalyst is for the good of that individual. Not everyone who runs likes doing so, but there's always some sort of satisfaction there.

That kind of inherent positivity has a way of building on itself. If a person feels good after one run, thereâ€™s a good chance he'll lace up again and again until he's running road races filled with people who are there for the same reason: because running provides some sort of solace, because it gives them goals and a means to accomplish them.

That understanding is like an energy at the Boston Marathon that washes from shouting spectators onto runners and flows among competitors. Itâ€™s almost like a party rather than a race. Getting to Boston was the hard part and, for many, that marathon is like a long victory lap. The Boston Marathon is the culmination of thousands of runners' personal goals. Watching tens of thousands of dreams come true within the span of a few hours is nothing short of incredible.

So when those two bombs ripped across the finish line last year, there was something especially obscene about the expressions of awe twisting into faces of shock, seeing tears of sadness where tears of happiness should have been.

Whether they meant to or not, the suspected bombers tried to deface a monument to human accomplishment. They tried to permanently alter the memory of the marathon, to leave an ugly asterisk alongside the goals people accomplish there, to etch a black mark onto something previously unblemished -- a mark that would forever undermine the future achievements of marathon runners.

Would the Boston Marathon ever be the same? That worry sprouted in my gut and slowly wound its way through my body. Itâ€™s painful to watch something pure reckon with the darker side of the world. So many wonderful memories are tied to that event, but ever since last year, a new nightmarish memory often seems to take over the narrative of the marathon.

Marathons are defined by moments in which the runner wants to quit. Random muscle spasms, unexpected back pain, the sudden burning desire to stop running and devour a dozen pancakes -- all of these things can, and often do, happen during a 26.2-mile run. Any can be enough to make a racer shut down.

Yet the vast majority of people run, walk or stumble across the finish line, and in that simple act you can see the folly of the bombers' actions.

Dance teacher Adrianne Haslet-Davis lost a leg in the bombings, but has already performed on stage before a crowd in the year since. Another victim, Rebekah Gregory, is awaiting her 17th surgery, but is starting a new life with her husband and son, also survivors of the blast. J.P. and Paul Norden both underwent leg amputations shortly after April 15, 2013, and now they hope to start a roofing company(Opens in a new window).

Did the bombers really think they could kill people's sense of hope? People, when surrounded by optimism, persevere, and those who take part in the Boston Marathon are about as optimistic as they come. Theyâ€™re fulfilling a dream.

On April 21, I will line up for my second Boston Marathon, for the first time since 2009. I expect the mood to be a strange mix of somber, joyous, anxious and reflective, but I also expect an aura of hope.

That hope, I think, will feel natural despite the shadow of last year. How could it not? Thousands of dreams will be about to come to fruition.

The four-door Trax, already available in Canada, represents GM's attempt to woo the urban crowd. The SUV puts a premium on space-saving for parking, as well as interior bells and whistles.

To that end, GM touted the Trax's use of Siri Eyes Free and MyLink(Opens in a new window), the company's voice-activated in-car system that enables drivers to connect mobile devices to it, as well as access a wide range of apps on a 7-inch color touchscreen.

After testing out the MyLink and Siri Eyes Free at the event, we were curious about the safety measures GM had in place to ensure that the increasingly compelling dashboard computing space wouldn't eventually lead to a distracted-driving hazard.

""We will approve everything that goes into our app store,"" Alan Batey, General Motors senior vice-president, told Mashable. ""We have over 17 years of experience with OnStar. So we have a lot of knowledge -- arguably more than anyone else in the industry -- and we'll use that knowledge. We will not put any apps in our vehicles that will in any way affect people's ability to keep their hands on the wheel and their eyes on the road. That's the number one priority.""

As for competition from dashboard-mounted devices that could offer alternative app experiences, Batey said, ""I believe a manufacturer-based, fully integrated system is so much safer than someone driving looking at a mobile device.""

GM's new CEO, Mary Barra, also made one of her first appearances since sitting before U.S. Congress earlier this month for a hearing related to the company's recall of defective ignition switches.

Barra stuck to a pre-written script, primarily extolling the virtues of GM and its new vehicles, and did not address the controversial recall in her official statement.

However, Batey later addressed some questions surrounding the recall.

""Recall is a part of our industry,"" he said. ""It's a big recall, but there was also one of our competitors announced a huge global recall, so they're part of our business.""

Batey also confirmed that some of the first repair parts had gone out to dealers earlier this week, and claimed that, based on internal data from March, the recall had not adversely affected GM's sales numbers.

""We've said everything we can about the recalls; we're obviously extremely sorry about what happened,"" he said. ""We've told everybody we're going to do this full investigation using the best people we can to go where the facts are. In due course, we'll be able to share with everybody what we've found out, and take it from there.""

If the recently exposed Heartbleed OpenSSL vulnerability didn't make the state of data security even more horrific, odds are you don't fully understand it.

SEE ALSO: Why Heartbleed Is the Ultimate Web Nightmare

For businesses and organizations, especially those of the small-to-medium variety, the need for security vigilance and data protection is as vital as it's ever been. It's estimated that cybercriminals steal $1 billion every year from small and medium-sized businesses in the U.S. and Europe.

For smaller businesses, data breaches don't only mean a potential lawsuit -- they could mean bankruptcy. In fact, 72% of businesses that suffer major data loss shut down within 24 months. Not all of this data loss occurs through malicious breaches like hacking, of course. Some is just simple negligence -- not backing up data (which 60% of small and medium businesses admit to being guilty of) and installing applications with vulnerabilities.

Money is likely the biggest factor in a lack of data security. In a 2013 survey(Opens in a new window) by the National Small Business Association, 44% of small business owners cited the cost of upgrading technology as one of their biggest challenges.

By focusing on these rivers, the Recyclone barge would effectively cut off the source of much of the pollution and greatly reduce the flow of waste into the ocean, Dyson said, who first detailed his idea to Time(Opens in a new window) for its Ideas Issue.

He later elaborated on the idea to FastCompany(Opens in a new window), explaining how the suction system might work and how the barge would process the waste it collects:

Large skim nets unfurl from the rollers at its stern and are anchored on each side of the river. Hydraulic winches wind them in and out. The nets face upstream and skim the surface of the river for floating debris. The plastic waste is shredded on board and then different grades of plastic are separated by a huge cyclone--very similar to the way our cyclonic vacuums work.

The idea is still very much a concept, but Dyson maintains it's a viable one. However, it's not much more than a few sketches at this point, so the trash-sucking barge would need a lot more work and testing before it could ever come to fruition.",4/15/2014 0:00,0.695652,3,10,1,4.080925,9,00000,2114.929,6014.192,4237.052,14733.33,0.525,0.259091,0.023121,0,0,0,1100
7004879,Why There Isn't a Vaccine for Ebola,"As a virologist, I am often asked when science will come up with a solution to stop deadly viruses, such as the current Ebola outbreak in Guinea(Opens in a new window). With collaborators, I've helped design and test over a hundred potentially life-saving antiviral drugs. These have led to patents and publications, which are the hallmarks of success in my profession - yet not one of these drugs has ever made it from the lab to market.

Pharmaceutical companies are businesses -- they last only as long as they continue to make money. While a new wonder drug may be hugely profitable in the short-term, the financial health of a company depends on its drug development pipeline, the ability to bring a steady flow of new drugs to the market in the long term. And a company is only as strong as its pipeline.

It takes time to dream up ways to attack a virus. Often what appears to be its Achilles heel turns out to be armor plated. Viruses are adaptable and thick-skinned, and have found many various ways to survive millions of years' worth of virus-crushing weaponry.

For every virus-stopping drug that makes it to market, several more will have dropped out during development. And many drugs that work well in sheets of cells that researchers use to grow viruses are completely ineffective in animals. Others go on to fail in people because they cause bad side effects, or are quickly broken down by the body's filter organs. Faced with these difficulties, it is a wonder that we have any new drugs at all.

So, developing new drugs that could treat diseases like Ebola is a financially risky proposition at best, though the results of a recent Ebola treatment trial looked promising(Opens in a new window).

Counting the cost

The current Ebola outbreak is nearing a hundred deaths in a period of about a month. As shocking as it sounds, if all of those people died in a single day, together with all the victims of SARS, MERS, bird flu, swine flu, and half a dozen viral hemorrhagic fevers, they wouldn't produce a noticeable blip in the daily death statistics. And as deadly as Ebola is, far more in Africa will die of malaria, tuberculosis and the complications of HIV this year.

This is why the early stages of drug and vaccine development are usually undertaken by small groups of scientists working in their own labs, relying on funds by governments, charities or universities. There are many potentially deadly viruses in the world, but few are considered widespread enough to merit the tens to hundreds of millions needed to bring a new vaccine to market. The process works, but it is slow - and practicalities kick in.

There are far more viruses in the world than virologists. We each have to choose what we work on. Self-interest plays a part. Why should the government of a country like the UK expend a large amount of money on Ebola, which only seems to crop up in sub-Saharan Africa? Especially when heart disease and cancer take far more lives both here and throughout the world? Well deadly diseases don't only cost lives.

The economic losses from a virus(Opens in a new window) can be enormous compared to the loss of life. The SARS epidemic of 2002-2003 infected about 8,000 people and claimed around 800 lives. Estimates of economic losses due to restricted trade, travel and heightened surveillance measures range from $40 to $80 billion. For each of the approximately 800 lives lost to SARS, the impact on the world economy was between $50 to $100 million -- far greater than the lifetime earning power of the victims.

No hiding place

Globalization means there's no hiding place from deadly viruses. Now that Ebola has spread to the Guinean port city of Conakry, there is more potential for the virus to be accidentally exported around the world. We should take note. Just as SARS was able to spread from China to 36 other countries around the world by commercial airline, there is the potential that Ebola could one day do the same. Mobility drives the spread of infectious diseases. As long as Ebola exists, and keeps crossing over from wildlife to humanity, the threat of a humanitarian disaster will always be there.

Treatments and promising vaccines are stuck in the small science pipeline. The cost of pushing these treatments through the last few sections is a barrier for most charities and ruinous for most private sector companies.

But once we recognize that Ebola (and other viral diseases) threatens the world and not just a small part of Africa, it becomes clear that a global problem demands a global action -- from the UN, African Union, G8, NATO, and the EU.",4/15/2014 0:00,0.720339,6,16,0,3.911111,10,00000,2056.087,7576.66,4381.027,28433.33,0.608578,-0.00956,0.059259,0.059259,1,-0.625,2200
6882432,Study: It Takes Effort to Turn Creativity Into Profit,"Creativity and innovation are crucial to businesses' growth, new research suggests.

If companies fail to integrate creativity and innovation into their business, they could be preventing themselves from reaching their full potential, according to a study from Rice University(Opens in a new window), the University of Edinburgh and Brunel University.

Creativity and innovation are complex, multilevel phenomena that pan out over time and require skillful leadership to maximize their benefits, the researchers said. Jing Zhou, a researcher at Rice University's Jones Graduate School of Business and one of the study's co-authors, said the vast majority of companies operating today are not doing a good job of translating creative ideas(Opens in a new window) into solutions that improve the firms' performance.

""Management needs to pay attention to capture employee creativity and implement the creative ideas,"" Zhou said. Moreover, companies focus too much on current goals and don't take the risks required to turn creativity into profits, she said.

Instead, Zhou said, businesses need to do a better job of training managers(Opens in a new window) to recognize a good idea and run with it.

""If you wait for the idea to be ready to be implemented, it might be too late,"" Zhou said. ""Managers need to capture promising ideas and then translate them into products, processes and improved customer service(Opens in a new window).""

The findings are the result of the authors' review of the rapidly growing body of research into creativity and innovation in the workplace, with particular attention to the period from 2002 to 2013.

""There are many of us who study employee creativity and many of us who study innovation and idea implementation, but we don't talk to each other; we're siloed,"" Zhou said. ""The review's goal is to integrate both.""

The research comes on the heels of a previous study conducted by Zhou. That study discovered that employee creativity did not lead directly to company performance and that firms had to make an effort in order for creativity to be channeled into positive results. The study suggested that managers need to cultivate, recognize and channel their employees' creativity into actual performance.

""The assumption is that once the employees demonstrate creativity, firms can translate it to firm-level performance,"" Zhou said. ""Our study proved otherwise.""",4/15/2014 0:00,0.418803,3,19,0,5.864407,10,00000,2193,9518.915,5571.316,62900,0.608125,-0.20813,0.008475,0.042373,0.395833,-0.20417,10400
7024809,I Am the Monster: Get Ready for Games to 'Evolve',"""Okay, you've got a 20-second head start,"" my guide says in my ear, his voice loud over my headphones.

I scramble forward in my new, dark surroundings. The woods around me echo with animal sounds as I look for food, safety, escape from what's coming.

[seealso slug=""iphone-android-multiplayer-games""]

Sniffing the air, the terrain around me springs to life as all the smaller creatures are illuminated. I need to pursue, hunt and kill them quickly so I can grow stronger. My survival depends on evolving from them, so I can take out the team of four pursuing me. Alone in the forest, I must hunt to avoid being the hunted.

This is the surprisingly solitary line of thinking found in Evolve, the upcoming cooperative/competitve shooter from 2K Games and Turtle Rock. The latter is best known for its groundbreaking cooperative four-player franchise Left 4 Dead, which puts a team of survivors against some of the most evil and creative zombies ever to grace video games.

A legacy like that leaves high expectations, and the preview of Evolve I played at PAX East shows plenty of promise both for gamers who want to work together, and for those who would rather don the lone wolf role.

Hunt, Run, Hide

Unlike every other character in the game, the monster is viewed in third-person, a switch 2K Games Executive Producer Denby Grace confirmed was done later in development. It's an important change, as you really get the sense of the size of the world around you, and how big and lurching you can become. Everything around the monster looks so small, especially the team of hunters you fight, so pulling the camera back gives a sense of power you wouldn't get if you just could see two huge claws in front of the camera.

For such a hulking beast, the monster moves like a dream, at least at the first level of evolution. An important gameplay element is being able to scrabble over all types of terrain, so you'll have to scale walls and jump away from foes quickly. Some of the fluid, parkour-like movements feel completely graceful; it was easy to lose myself in running away. Your speed is the advantage so early, as you are a lot weaker than your combined foes.

Thus, the early strategy for the monster involves hunting, using its ability to sense prey to quickly take down other beasts. As you eat, you fill up your evolution meter and prepare for the next level. While this match allowed me to play a monster called Goliath, there will be other monsters with different powers in the full game.

But of course, you are constantly being chased by a team of four hunters, each with very specific abilites to take down the monster -- the game only ends when you win or you die.

The biggest threat to the monster is the trapper. That character can snare you with electric threads and pull you toward the group, and also lay down a large electric force field to keep you from fleeing the area. The monster should take them out first, and likewise, the group should protect him. In my play experience, the group left the trapper for dead, and it lead to a much longer play time for me after I ate him.

The second biggest threat to the monster is the medic, who provides support to the team via healing and a sniper rifle. Following that, you'll want to take out the support and assault characters, who are both able to deal massive damage to you.

Evolution

All of this is secondary to your need for flesh, because you're a giant, bloodthirsty monster. So eating was a priority, even when I was running away. Getting to the second stage of evolution quickly changed the dynamic of the match.

Once you evolve, you immediately get to put skill points into slots. You also get a huge health boost, though you are temporarily a little more vulerarable until the process is over. But heaven help the team of hunters once I was more powerful; the dynamic of the match quickly changed to where I wanted to chase them.

Along with basic melee attacks, the monster is equipped with lots of ways to do damage. You have two different types of jumps that allow you to close ground between you and a foe. My favorite attack was the rock throw, which could put a lot of hurt on a fleeing hunter, or one that had taken to the air to avoid my swiping claws.

You do lose a great deal of speed and mobility after evolution, which means changing strategies. You won't be able to always outrun the group of hunters, but you may not really want to.

While I was taken down before the final stage of evolution, it was easy to see how it would progress. A much more powerful, but barely mobile monster has a very distinct play style, and hopefully you've taken out at least a couple members of the hunting party before reaching that level.

Grace told me the game is built around catering to these different play styles: gamers who love to work as a team, and those that love to play by themselves. The four hunters can't succeed unless they stick to their roles, and the monster must be able to adapt to a number of situations. There will be options for players to create matches based on whatever class they favor online, or play offline against AI.

There's still a lot to learn about Evolve. We don't know the status of a campaign mode yet, or anything really beyond the matches played at press demos and at PAX. But the game shows huge promise as a fun, compelling experience that players will want to come back to over and over.

7004928,Paul Walker's Brothers Will Fill in the Gaps in 'Fast and Furious 7',"Two brothers of the late Paul Walker have joined the cast of Fast and Furious 7 to help filmmakers complete unfinished action scenes for the movie.

Universal Pictures had halted production of the film out of respect for Walker, who died in a car crash at age 40 on Nov. 30. But a long note to fans on the film's Facebook page on Tuesday revealed that filming had resumed -- with help from Walker's siblings, Caleb and Cody.

[seealso slug=""tyrese-gibson-paul-walker-god-interview/""]

""Paul had already shot his dramatic scenes and most of his action for Fast and Furious 7, and itâ€™s among the strongest work of his career,"" the post reads. ""We have resumed shooting and now welcome Paul's brothers, Caleb and Cody, into our Fast and Furious family.

""Caleb and Cody are helping us complete some remaining action for their brother, and fill in small gaps left in production. Having them on set has made us all feel that Paul is with us too.""

Walker played undercover agent Brian O'Conner in the Fast and Furious films, which have earned $2.3 billion worldwide since 2001. Fast and Furious 7 is scheduled to hit theaters on April 10, 2015. It was slated to debut in July before producers changed the date following Walker's death.

""This film is the most important weâ€™ve ever done together,"" the Facebook post continues. ""It will allow the character of Brian Oâ€™Conner to live on and let us celebrate Paul in his most defining role.""

Facebook has been the primary way for fans to stay up-to-date on the film's production developments.

Credit: Robert Herrick

Now, a new discovery from a poetry fan reveals that the smiley may date as early as 1648, when it appeared in a poem called ""To Fortune"" by Robert Herrick. Found by Levi Stahl(Opens in a new window), publicity manager for the University of Chicago Press, and first reported(Opens in a new window) by The Atlantic, the poem has a smiley face next to the words ""smiling yet.""

SEE ALSO: A Brief History of the Emoticon

It could, of course, be a typo, but it could also be deliberate -- after all, the concept of the smiley is pretty simple and could easily be as old as typography itself. However, this doesn't seem to be the case here.

We've checked a couple of other editions of Herrick's poetry including The Poetical Works of Robert Herrick Vol II(Opens in a new window)., Hesperides or Works Both Human and Divine(Opens in a new window), as well as The Works of Robert Herrick (ed. by T. Maitland)(Opens in a new window), and the smiley doesn't appear in either version.

The New Atlantis chimes in with its analysis, claiming that parentheses weren't widely used(Opens in a new window) in Herrick's time. It's thus likely that the parenthesis was inserted by a modern editor.

While there's still a possibility that Robert Herrick used a smiley in the 17th century, we'll need more solid proof to be sure.

7004898,Ford to Put Mustang Atop Empire State Building for 50th Anniversary,"Half a century ago, before the Internet and viral-video stunts, Ford took one of its brand new Mustang convertibles, cut it into three pieces, stuffed it into the Empire State Building's tiny elevator and sent it all the way up to the 86th floor. Then the company reassembled the car, and drove it around the the Manhattan landmark's observation deck. Now, to mark the Mustang's 50th anniversary -- and because Ford apparently had so much fun the last time -- the automaker is doing it again.

Of course, Ford is not chopping up a priceless old Mustang. Instead, the company is using one of its freshly minted 2015 models (you can see them slicing and dicing it in the video, above). Unveiled late last year, the 2015 Ford Mustang is both a throwback, with lines and curves reminiscent of the late 1960s Mustang Mach II, and an update, as the front shows hints of the futuristic-looking Ford Fusion with its slit-like headlights.

This time, however, Ford and its partner in high-rise crime DST Industries(Opens in a new window) had to cut the car up into even more pieces. Prakash Patel, Ford's Mustang program manager, explained, â€œThe car is actually bigger, longer and wider than what it was in 1965. Remember, the Empire State Building is exactly how is was 50 years ago, so we have a significant challenge.â€

The elevators used to transport the car pieces nearly 1000 feet up are just 36-inches wide. In order to ensure that the trips go smoothly (each segment rides alone), DST built an Empire State Building elevator replica in its shop, and carefully placed each piece inside it.

The other goal was to ensure the 2015 Ford Mustang didn't end up looking like it was reconstituted from six separate pieces. So DST also built a special subframe that goes underneath the Mustang, and bolts the body and suspension together.

Once the observation deck closed to visitors on Monday, Ford and DST had just five hours to move and reassemble the 2015 Ford Mustang before unveiling it atop the iconic Empire State Building on April 16 (it will remain on display until April 17). Mashable will be present at the event, and will report on Ford's handiwork.

50 years ago...

If you're curious about how Ford did it the first time, check out the following photos for a mini walk-through.

The operation to tear down a whole and healthy Mustang, 15 long, into four major sections and many smaller pieces enters a critical stage. The well-trained team of specialists skillfully and cautiously separates two sections by unfastening clamps, and sliding pipe rails apart on both sides of the car. The technique of reducing the Mustang into four sections proceeded so smoothly, the job was successfully completed in about an hour. Credit: Ford Motor Co.

Removed from the operating arena on 33rd Street, the front third of the disjointed Mustang is precisely tucked into a waiting elevator to be whisked to the 86th floor observation area. The front and rear sections of the car were wheeled into the lobby in rickshaw fashion. The sections and all the other pieces were carefully assembled, and joined together again in a reverse operation on the 86th floor, more than 1,000 feet above the street. Credit: Ford Motor Co.

Once again restored to robust health and with the hazards of Operation Mustang safely concluded, the 1966 convertible recuperates while perched on a corner of the 86th floor parapet. The car was later moved inside the building to the observation deck where it will be on public display to be viewed by thousands of visitors to the famed landmark until next spring. It is the first car ever to be put on the observation deck and the biggest and heaviest object ever on display there. Credit: Ford Motor Co.

This latest Ford stunt ends just before the start of the New York International Auto Show, which kicks off on April 18, and takes place at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center, just a few blocks from the Empire State Building.

In the films, he will continue his role as gamemaker Plutarch Heavensbee. Lionsgate said Hoffman nearly finished shooting all of his scenes, as filming for the second Mockingjay movie was heading into its final days before his death.

Google announced the plan last week. ""Every day, we get requests from those of you who havenâ€™t found a way into the program yet, and we want your feedback too,"" the company wrote in a blog post(Opens in a new window).

Google Glass is not commercially available yet; it's been available only to Google Glass Explorers -- in other words, only through a very limited beta-testing program.

Now, Google is opening up the program and folks in the U.S. will be able to get the Glass for $1500 + tax. Google has apologized to everyone else, saying it's ""just not ready yet to bring Glass to other countries.""

The price is steep, but at least Google will throw in frames or a shade of your choice.

[seealso slug=""cool-city-maps""]

One of the biggest frustrations among introverts is the advice doled out by so-called experts to ""help"" introverts become more social, a hot media trend of recent years. I want to scream at them: ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it!""

Dr. Andrea Letamendi is a clinical psychologist, scientist and speaker. She spoke with Mashable about the definition of introverts and the (many times inaccurate) portrayals that surround them on the Internet.

People do not fit into a binary system.

Credit: gemini-dragon-gifs

The first step we must take in understanding introverts -- and extroverts, for that matter -- is that no one really fits either type 100% of the time.

""Think of it as continuum, in that some people are low on the introversion scale, and others are high, and of course, some of us are around the middle,"" says Dr. Letamendi.

Most are actually ambiverts, people drawn to both inner and outer experiences. Ultimately, any label you slap on a person without knowing her is most likely incorrect.

Introversion isn't a disorder.

Credit: thatsmypurseidontknowyou

One of the most persistent problems facing introverts is the idea that they need to be ""fixed."" Fear is a motivating factor behind this particular misconception, and it's perpetuated by the 24-hour news cycle. in particular.

More often than not, the term ""introvert"" is hastily applied to the sometimes uneasy, quiet teens who end up on the evening news for committing heinous crimes against their classmates or themselves. But these people are not typical introverts, and their introversion was not the cause of the events that made them infamous.

Most of the news coverage surrounding Aurora, Colo., shooter James Holmes harps on the fact that he was ""quiet""(Opens in a new window) and ""shy."" The same words have been used over and over again to describe people who commit mass murder.

How does highlighting a person's introversion get to the real story of what's going on in his or her head? It can't.

""Introversion is not a condition, not a disorder, and certainly not acknowledged in the psychiatric classification of disorders as a mental health problem,"" explains Dr. Letamendi, adding that when people see something they can't understand at face value, it's easy to suspect the worst of it.

In reality, introverts are happy, social people with a circle of friends whom they trust. We may not always be social butterflies, but that doesn't mean we want to stay locked away from the world. In the same vein, extroverts can also struggle with social anxiety and depression. Mental illness doesn't choose a particular personality. Mental health is just part of being a human.

Using introversion as an excuse.

Credit: neeeephilim

It is possible to be happy and outgoing while still being an introverted special snowflake. However, some people try to rationalize that they are introverted because they have social anxiety, or they're anti-social, but this isn't introversion at all.

""It's a misconception that people who are introverted dislike other people or find social interaction aversive or distressing. It's also a misconception that introverts have deficits in social skills,"" says Dr. Letamendi.

So when a self-proclaimed introvert says, ""I hate people,"" it's important to recognize this isn't introversion. Introverts love people; we just dislike small talk. Introverts are more inclined to talk about deeper subject matters, so we're probably more interested in a story from your childhood or a philosophy theory than the weather or what you ate for breakfast. Most introverts have great social skills -- we just need the right setting.

Unfortunately, introverts often struggle maintaining their relationships with their extroverted friends. There are countless stories on the Internet of people dumping their buddies because the latter didn't want to go party. The resulting isolation often leads to depression and increased anxiety, even for introverts who did not suffer before.

If an introvert is experiencing symptoms of depression -- low energy, fatigue, irritability and lack of interest in things a person would normally be interested in -- it's not because of introversion, but it can be easy to get trapped in a cycle of isolation and not know which came first.

Introversion doesn't make you a genius.

Credit: thismindisacircus

If you look at Tumblr, introverts like to associate themselves with scholarly pursuits and nerd culture. Introversion, as Dr. Letamendi says, is a ""stable personality trait."" Therefore, it cannot logically affect a person's aptitude, as much as myself and my fellow introverts would all love this myth to be true. In fact, there are many extroverts who are just as smart and nerdy as introverts, and not all introverts are geniuses by default, though many introverts generally enjoy activities like reading and writing.

So how can we set aside our differences and just play nicely? If we change the way we think and behave -- introverts and extroverts alike -- there may be hope for us yet.

1. Introverts, keep your ""me"" time, but cut back on the Internet.

Credit: thepetcollective

If you need to be alone, do it. Make your downtime pleasurable and use it to do your favorite activities. It's important for an introvert to recharge, so dump any negativity you might have.

Seeking out support or social interaction is fine, to a point. However, Dr. Letamendi warns, ""Spending time on the Internet is associated with perceived stronger social support and increased confidence, but those benefits come with some costs when it comes to actual face-to-face encounters. One Temple University study, for instance, found that introverts who frequently used the Internet reported less community involvement, increased loneliness, increased negative affect, increased time pressure, and decreased self-esteem over the course of the study relative to introverts who rarely used it.""

So, all that time spent talking about being an introvert on Reddit or Tumblr might be hurting you more than you think.

2. Extroverts, try changing up your social schedule with your introvert friends, once in a while.

Credit:

Your introvert friends love a good party now and then, but they also just want to sit and have a cup of coffee with you. Why not change things up and plan some more introverted activities when your friend isn't feeling up to a big group? Sometimes, she just wants to hang out, one-on-one.

3. Realize relationships are a two-way street.

Credit: dewogong

Some introverts need understanding and patience, but no one likes to be rejected all the time. A common problem among introverts is that they like to be invited to the party, even if they don't go. Often, this situation ends with the introvert being dumped by their friends and feeling betrayed. But this situation isn't necessarily fair to their extroverted friends, either. At some point, the introvert should exert some effort and go to the party. It's important to compromise.

4. Give yourself something to do.

Credit: televandalist

If you are at a party where you don't know many people, or you just don't want to be your friend's shadow all night, find a job. Feel like you can make it as a mixologist? Create some cocktails for the guests. Bartenders aren't just great at making drinks; they also listen to people's stories. Or, if you're more of an audiophile, play DJ for the night. Nothing brings people together like musical requests.

5. Decompress.

Find a quiet spot during the party to keep you from overloading. It will make the gathering much more enjoyable and you'll feel less drained after all the social stimuli. Afterward, take an hour for some quiet time at home to wind down. And don't feel bad about it.

6. Make a plan.

Introverts like to plan things. If you are more of an extrovert, perhaps dropping in unannounced or proposing spontaneous bar hopping isn't the most enjoyable activity for your introverted pal. Let him know what is happening so he can make a game plan: where he's going, when he can decompress, and when he should call it a night, is all very important.

7024530,Google Previews New Designs for Its Modular Smartphones,"Google revealed new details about its plans for Project Ara, the company's highly anticipated Android-powered modular smartphone at its Project Ara developers conference Tuesday.

The conference aims to give developers a better understanding of how they can take advantage of the platform, and elaborates on the guidelines revealed to them last week when Google released its Module Developers Kit.

[seealso slug= ""project-ara-developer-kit/""]

Paul Eremenko, head of Project Ara, said two more developers conferences are planned for July and September of this year, and the first smartphones are expected to ship next January. Android will be updated in December, prior to the release of the phones, to support Ara's modular components.

Eremenko said the first phone released will be a generic ""gray phone,"" which will cost developers about $50 to make. However, he did not reveal what the eventual retail price would be. The phone will be purposely designed to be ""drab"" to encourage owners to be creative, and personalize their devices, Eremenko added.

The Credit: Project Ara

Users will be able to use the Ara Configurator to create their own custom look for each of the phone's individual modules. Onstage, Project Ara's team showed off a few examples of the design possibilities.

For example, users can import photos into Ara's Configurator, which will create a personalized design based off of the color palette in the images. Or, they can create customized 3D-printed textures for the surface of their device's modules. These textures, which can only be placed on the top surface of modules, are designed to be easily replaceable, so users can swap them out when they want a new design.

Ara's Configurator will also allow users to create customized textures for the surface of their device's modules. Credit: Project Ara

One of the advantages that Ara's platform offers is extending the period of time users can go without replacing their device, Eremenko said. Since users can swap out individual components, such as the processor or camera, Ara's devices will have a much longer lifespan.

Unlike typical smartphones, which most users tend to replace at least once every two years, Eremenko said Google expects Ara's devices will last between five and six years.

That's the message in a new ad from Foot Locker and Adidas featuring NBA All-Star Damian Lillard, who just inked a massive, eight-year deal(Opens in a new window) with Adidas. Lillard's deal is believed to be the third-largest shoe contract in the league â€” behind only Chicago's Derrick Rose and Miami's LeBron James â€” so the Portland Trail Blazers guard is in good company.

On Tuesday, NBCUniversal became the latest traditional media giant to jump in the online original programming pool, announcing a slew of digital-first shows including Tesla and Twain, a comedic series that imagines what would happen if Mark Twain and Nikola Tesla (who were real-life friends in their time) were suddenly transported to modern-day Los Angeles.

Gee, Iâ€™d probably watch that on TV.

Other projects coming via the initiative announced Tuesday include Last Single Girl, about an underemployed young woman whose friends are all marrying off (sound like any TV shows you know?) and Saturday Night Line, which follows the superfans who camp in the standby line outside 30 Rock in hopes of catching the, uh, TV show.

Also coming to NBC.com is the previously announced Heroes Reborn: Digital Series, a prequel to the (ahem, TV) show that ran from 2006 to 2010.

NBCUniversalâ€™s initiative will be produced by multiple arms of the media giant: Tesla and Twain, Last Single Girl and other series are coming from Universal Cable Productions, while Saturday Night Line and Heroes are productions of Universal Television.

NBCU will promote and distribute the online-first programs across its many television networks and online properties, including channel websites, Hulu and video-on-demand. Oh yes, there will be â€œbranded contentâ€ -- NBCU says that in many cases, â€œthe development of these digital series will be in direct collaboration with advertising partners.â€

â€œMuch of the uncaptured value in the online world can be unlocked with smart collaborations between creators and clients,â€ said NBCUniversal cable president and chief content officer Jeff Wachtel.

Yep, thereâ€™s gold in them hills.

The announcement comes one day after the frantic square dance between Hollywood studios and YouTube multichannel networks gained a formidable new contestant. On Monday, Lionsgate announced a partnership with RocketJump, creators of Video Game High School.

This is a strategic partnership -- not an acquisition, like Disneyâ€™s pending pickup of Maker Studios -- but itâ€™s still an important moment in Hollywoodâ€™s courtship of the YouTube set.

The latest hookup puts RocketJump, one of YouTubeâ€™s most established multi-channel networks, in business with Lionsgate, one of Hollywoodâ€™s most digitally savvy film and TV studios. Basically, Lionsgate gets access to RocketJumpâ€™s know-how, fan base and digital slate, while RocketJump has access to Lionsgateâ€™s massive global distribution and marketing machine.

The so-called Demographics Unit consisted of plain clothes detectives infiltrating Muslim neighborhoods to create dossiers and maps of where residents prayed, shopped and ate, the Associated Press revealed(Opens in a new window) in 2011. The goal of the program was to identify would-be terrorists blending with other members of the community.

The department reportedly told a group of advocates last week that the covert program was shut down. The unit has been inactive since the new NYPD chief William Bratton took over from Ray Kelly in January, and its detectives have been reassigned, NYPD's spokesperson Stephen Davis told the Times.

""Understanding certain local demographics can be a useful factor when assessing the threat information that comes into New York City virtually on a daily basis,"" Davis said. ""In the future, we will gather that information, if necessary, through direct contact between the police precincts and the representatives of the communities they serve.""

In other words, no more CIA-like covert operations.

Alternatively, you can pay an annual rate of $69.99, which translates into $13.89 in savings every year if you go that route.

Office for iPad launched in March, so the prospect of using Office on a tablet is now attractive to many more people. With that launch, Microsoft also made Office Mobile for smartphones free to use, and the web apps -- which users can access from any connected device -- are free as well.

Since Office 365 Personal is intended for one user, the 20GB of free OneDrive storage is limited to one account; Office 365 Home subscribers, which Microsoft markets as ""Office for families,"" get 20GB for up to five separate users, for a total of 100GB of free storage.

7024422,Scientists Identify When Innocent Bacteria Became Flesh-Eating Horror,"Bacterial diseases cause millions of deaths every year. Most of these bacteria were benign at some point in their evolutionary past, and we don't always understand what turned them into disease-causing pathogens. In a new study, researchers have tracked down when this switch happened in a flesh-eating bacteria. They think the knowledge might help predict future epidemics.

The flesh-eating culprit in question is called GAS, or Group A Î²-hemolytic streptococcus, a highly infective bacteria. Apart from causing flesh-eating disease(Opens in a new window), GAS is also responsible for a range of less harmful infections. It affects more than 600 million people every year, and causes an estimated 500,000 deaths.

These bacteria appeared to have affected humans since the 1980s. Scientists think that GAS must have evolved from a less harmful streptococcus strain. The new study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences(Opens in a new window), reconstructs that evolutionary history.

James Musser of the Methodist Hospital Research Institute and lead researcher of the study said, ""This is the first time we have been able to pull back the curtain to reveal the mysterious processes that gives rise to a virulent pathogen.""

Genetic gymnastics

Musser's work required analysis of the bacterial genetic data from across the world -- a total of about 3,600 streptococcus strains were collected and their genomes recorded. It revealed that a series of distinct genetic events turned this bacteria rogue.

First, foreign DNA moved into the original harmless streptococcus by horizontal gene transfer(Opens in a new window) -- a phenomenon that is common among bacteria. Such DNA is often provided by bacteriophages, viruses that specifically target bacteria. Picking up foreign genes can be useful because it can improve the bacteria's survival.

In this case, the foreign DNA that was incorporated in the host's genome allowed the streptococcus cell to produce two harmful toxins. A further mutation to one of these toxin genes made it even more virulent.

According to Musser, another horizontal gene transfer event made a good disease-causing pathogen into a very good one. The additional set of genes allowed it to produce proteins that suppress the immune system of those infected, making the infection worse.

Marco Oggioni of the University of Leicester said, ""Because this study used data of the entire genome, all the genetic change could be observed. This makes it possible to identify molecular events responsible for virulence, as you get the full picture.""

Musser could also accurately date the genetic changes in GAS by using statistical models to, as it were, turn back the clock on evolution. They say the last genetic change, which made GAS a highly virulent bacteria, must have occurred in 1983.

Continental drift

That timing makes a lot of sense. ""The date we deduced coincided with numerous mentions of streptococcus epidemics in the literature,"" Musser said. Since 1983, there have been several outbreaks of streptococcus infections across the world. For example, in the UK, streptococcus infections increased in number and severity between 1983 and 1985(Opens in a new window).

It is the same story for many other countries, with Sweden(Opens in a new window), Norway(Opens in a new window), Canada(Opens in a new window) and Australia(Opens in a new window) falling victim to what is now an inter-continental epidemic. The symptoms ranged from pharyngitis to the flesh-eating disease, necrotizing fasciitis.

""In the short term, this discovery will help us determine the pattern of genetic change within a bacteria, and may help us work out how often bacterial vaccines need to be updated,"" Musser said. ""In the long term, this technique may have an important predictive application -- we may be able to nip epidemics in the bud before they even start.""

What Musser is suggesting is that if enough bacterial genomes are regularly recorded and monitored, there is a chance that mutations or gene transfers, such as those GAS experienced, could be found ahead of time.

But Oggioni is skeptical. ""While making such predictions may not be possible, this research will have other applications,"" he said. ""Knowing which genetic changes happen when can help tailor drug discovery research in a certain direction.""

Oggioni added that Musser's work with GAS is only a model. Using Musser's methods to record the evolutionary histories of other pathogens could be quite useful to tackle the diseases they cause now and, perhaps, even those that they may cause in the future.",4/15/2014 0:00,0.515152,11,2,0,4.52973,8,Lifestyle,829,4929.455,3177.9,5600,0.478704,0.234292,0.045946,0.016216,0,0,1700

Twitter and Gnip announced a partnership in 2010 that provided the ""firehose"" of data to clients, helping to generate revenue from the information created by Twitter's user base.

""We want to make our data even more accessible, and the best way to do that is to work directly with our customers to get a better understanding of their needs. To that end, we have agreed to acquire Gnip, a leading provider of social data and a long-standing Twitter data partner,"" Twitter wrote in a blog post(Opens in a new window).

Gnip was founded in 2008 and claims to be Twitter's first data partner. It works with a variety of clients including Tumblr, WordPress and Foursquare. It also provides Twitter data to the Library of Congress.

""Combining forces with Twitter allows us to go much faster and much deeper. Weâ€™ll be able to support a broader set of use cases across a diverse set of users including brands, universities, agencies, and developers big and small,"" Gnip said in a statement on its blog(Opens in a new window).

Gnip is among Twitter's most major acquisitions since its purchase of MoPub, a mobile advertising exchange, in September for $350 million in stock. It recently purchased Cover, an Android lockscreen app, and SecondSync, and Mesagraph.

Gnip adds to some of Twitter's other analytics acquisitions including social TV firm Bluefin Labs and real-time data company Locomatix.

The move to buy Gnip, as well as some of its other acquisitions, shows Twitter's interest in expanding its business.

""They're buying up the pieces of their ecosystem that are either close to the customer or close to their revenue. Gnip is both,"" said Will McInnes, CMO of Brandwatch, which is a customer of both Gnip and Twitter.

""Social data is the new oil. This is where really valuable insights can be derived and derived really quickly. When you think about what's valuable about Twitter this has to be one of the top three assets they have,"" he added.

Though Twitter makes most of its money via advertising, data licensing accounted for $23 million(Opens in a new window) -- about 9.5% of the companies revenues in Twitter's fourth quarter, which ended Dec. 31, 2013. That figure was up 80% year-over-year, the company reported.

Companies use the data to make decisions about marketing. For instance, Dick's Sporting Goods last year tapped Twitter's firehouse to discover why some customers were coming into stores and not buying anything. Businesses also use the data to decide where to put new factories and evaluate consumers' moods.

With Twitter acquiring a popular analytics company, there is some question over whether it will continue to provide its data to other firms that could now be seen as competitors. The CEO of DataSift told TechCrunch(Opens in a new window) that his company has a long-term deal with Twitter and that the Gnip acquisition would not change anything.

McInnes said time will tell on Twitter's relationship with other analytics firms.

""It will be interesting also to see how Twitter proceeds with other partners that have this kind of relationship with them,"" he said. ""Now that they've bought one, the question is: what happens to the others?""",4/15/2014 0:00,0.689655,4,0,2,4.68599,6,00000,0,6014.192,3167.458,2100,0.391993,0.158007,0.033816,0.014493,0,0,3100
7004459,Show Off Your Writing Chops for B.J. Novak in Our Twitter Fiction Contest,"Forget about the Great American Novel. Nowadays, people are arguably more focused on composing the Great Global Tweet, which is not something to be taken lightly. In just 140 characters, you have to communicate intelligence, humor, wit or, ideally, some combination. Some take the next step and compose entire stories in under 140 characters. It's a challenge, but one we think the Mashable community is up for: This month's Twitter Fiction Contest will give you a chance to prove yourself.

Author and comedian B.J. Novak explores a range of human emotions in his debut short story collection, which is also this month's MashableReads selection. One More Thing: Stories and Other Stories is both profound and hilarious, satiric and honest. Novak also challenges the conventional length of short stories; after all, in the 21st century, why does a story have to be any longer than a single tweet?

Twitter confirmed Tuesday that it has hired Daniel Graf to serve as its new VP of consumer product.

7004455,Case Study Shows How Twitter Advertising Can Pay Off,"Twitter is on a roll when it comes to advertising. In the past year, it's shown it's serious about offering marketers the options and analytics they need - even if it means becoming more like Facebook. HowAboutWe says the changes are paying off.

HowAboutWe operates an online dating service for singles, as well as a date-planning service for couples. A customer acquisition campaign in the fourth quarter of 2013 used Twitter's geo- and interest-targeting to reach couples in five markets. Promoted tweets offered $50 off dating experiences booked through the service.

Using its internal analytics, the company found that leads coming from the Twitter promotion were 20% more likely to convert to paying subscribers than other channels where the promotion was offered, including the website and emails. It also found that Twitter leads are 20% more likely to convert to paying subscribers than the rest of the brand's traffic.

HowAboutWe also found that the Twitter campaign offering the $50 discount improved its cost per acquisition by 800% over other Twitter campaigns that didn't offer a discount. Moreover, 30% of its total traffic now comes from Twitter.

Although four-year-old HowAboutWe has advertised on Twitter since 2012, results were not always as strong, according to chief executive (CEO) Brian Schechter. ""In the early days, our experience was lackluster both from the standpoint of our ability to target and of our ability to have transparency into what was happening with specific campaigns,"" he says. ""All the basic things you'd expect from an ad platform were not there.""

In July of 2013, Twitter began testing Tailored Audience Advertising, a produce similar to Facebook Custom Audiences, that lets brands create custom audience segments and then find those people on Twitter. The offering became generally available in December 2013.

""Twitter has definitely reached a level of maturity where we can rely on it,"" Schechter says.

However, there's still room for improvement, adds Aaron Stein, HowAboutWe's director of acquisitions. ""We wish it was a platform like Google AdWords where you can do things like make bulk edits to bids and campaign budgets, or update a lot of different tweets to test a bunch of stuff at once. There is still a lot of manual stuff that's necessary.""

Even with the availability of third-party campaign management tools that promise to let marketers optimize and analyze campaigns across social media, Stein and Schechter have found it's better to use the individual services' platforms.

""I wouldn't say it's impossible, but what we care about is that each platform is highly efficient, rather than the dream of everything bundled into one platform. We have experimented in the past, but it never comes close to efficiency you find using the actual ad platform,"" Schechter says.",4/15/2014 0:00,0.766667,1,0,1,4.601626,6,00000,0,6014.192,3533.796,47800,0.646667,-0.00667,0.02439,0.00813,0,0,145500
7024317,Ukraine 'Anti-Terror' Operation Leaves 2 Injured in Airfield Skirmish,"Media outlets owned by the Russian government are reporting that a Ukrainian military assault on an airfield in the Eastern city of Kramatorsk on Tuesday has resulted in four deaths(Opens in a new window) and two injuries, but details remain unclear.

Pro-Russian government militias, which the Ukrainian government and other Western nations insist are actually Russian special forces, had taken the airfield as well as a number of buildings in cities across Eastern Ukraine over the past week. Ukrainian interim President Oleksandr Turchynov accused these militias of terrorizing Ukrainian citizens and on Tuesday initiated an ""anti-terrorism"" effort to reclaim that territory through military force, after warning Russian forces to evacuate by Sunday, April 13.

â€œI call on all citizens in the east of our country -- do not serve as tools in a foreign war against our own country,"" Turchynov said in a statement on Sunday, according to Kyiv Post. ""Do not support those who want to destroy the peace and who push your region into the abyss of economic disaster, the abyss of civil conflict. I appeal to every Ukrainian: We must unite in the face of foreign aggression.â€

Kyiv Post reports that two pro-Russian militiamen were injured(Opens in a new window) in the fighting at Kramatorsk, and that fighting there continues.

Details about the extent of the fighting are still murky at best. Some reports say Ukrainian soldiers captured Russian officers(Opens in a new window) at the airfield. Others say that two were injured(Opens in a new window) in the battle, while Moscow-owned media are reporting the death of four others(Opens in a new window) along with the injured.

The death toll reported remains unconfirmed, and it would be in Moscow's interest to incite anger against the Ukrainian government by exaggerating the violence enacted by Ukrainian forces. The Kremlin has claimed that its Western neighbor is headed toward ""civil war(Opens in a new window),"" though others blame Russian forces(Opens in a new window) for inciting the violence.

Pro-Russian gangs and militias have attacked Ukrainian government buildings in Donetsk, Luhans, Kharkiv and other cities over the past week, and a select few have called for a vote for their city's independence.

Ukraine and Western nations say Russia is trying to stir chaos in Eastern Ukraine as a pretext for an invasion, while Russia says the Ukrainian government simply cannot control its own people.

The trouble echoes the brief build-up to the Russian invasion of Crimea, a tiny, once-autonomous peninsula in the South of Ukraine, that took place in the beginning of March.

6422025,That US Airways Employee Won't Be Fired for 'Honest Mistake',"The US Airways employee who accidentally tweeted a lewd picture from the company's Twitter account will not be fired, according to US Airways spokesperson Matt Miller.

""It was an honest mistake,"" Miller said on Tuesday.

[seealso slug=http://mashable.com/2014/04/14/us-airways-best-tweets/]

The company had ""investigated"" the situation and determined that the picture was erroneously posted after a it was first tweeted at the account by a user. Then, in an attempt to flag the picture as inappropriate and notify Twitter, a US Airways employee accidentally ended up including it in its own tweet.

""It was done as part of the process to capture the tweet to flag it as inappropriate,"" Miller said. ""Unfortunately, the link to the image was inadvertently included in a response to a customer.""

The US Airways Twitter feed has not been updated for more than 24 hours, with the last tweet being the company's apology for the picture.

We apologize for an inappropriate image recently shared as a link in one of our responses. Weâ€™ve removed the tweet and are investigating.â€” US Airways (@USAirways) April 14, 2014(Opens in a new window)

Leila Thabet, managing director of social media agency We Are Social, said that the nature of the situation and the fact that it was clearly a mistake had allowed US Airways to sidestep major criticism. Most media seemed content to report on the situation and regard it as a warning: Social media is an important but risk-laden tool.

The lack of clear intent made the incident even easier for US Airways, unlike other social media gaffes like an attempt by Kenneth Cole to make light of the uprising in Cairo, Egypt.

""It was so bizarre that if you compare it to the Kenneth Cole, that was actually the brand getting behind a sensitive message,"" Thabet said.

US Airways making public statements and refraining from publicly firing the employee in question is a positive sign, Thabet added. ""They haven't thrown anyone under the bus,"" she said.

The US Airways gaffe represents a brutal example, but one from which the company can recover.

""This is an example of the worst possible thing can always happen to any brand,"" said Allen Adamson, managing director of brand management firm Landor Associate. ""What's critical is moving quickly, over-communicating and taking actions that will try to prevent it from reoccurring.""

(In case you missed the Internet these past 24 hours, yes, it really was that ridiculous.)

All too often in times like these (granted, there aren't too many examples on this level), executives unfamiliar with this unruly turf scramble to contain uncontainable damage. Heads must roll, they silently agree, oftentimes blaming the 20-something marketing ""rockstar"" who previously had been ""killing it"" with year-over-year growth on the company's high-value social channels.

As a former 20-something rockstar who killed it (these are your words, social media marketers, not mine), let me tell you why this move is always a mistake.

Everyone @USAirways(Opens in a new window) is about to fire ought to be promoted instead that was some real 10x growth hackingâ€” Mat Honan (@mat) April 14, 2014(Opens in a new window)

Left to toil away in obscurity, the world's social media managers are all too often nameless, faceless and thankless to the millions who welcome their tweets into their everyday lives. They spend their days staring deeply into various dashboards that were created to help them craft tweets, schedule postings and monitor brand mentions.

Engagement is the name of the game and it's all done selflessly for the good of the brand.

The dashboards, which have names like Sprinklr, Spreadfast, Tracx, HootSuite, SocialQ, Percolate, Brandwatch, Buffer, SocialFlow, Sprout and Argyle, were all created under a range of promises, but really help people do one thing: use Twitter.com better than Twitter.com allows.

Twitter, you see, was never created to be a customer service tool.

And yet that's just how the country's major airlines -- which some say(Opens in a new window) shouldn't be on Twitter at all -- are using it.

.@USAirways(Opens in a new window) If you fire that employee I will lead a global campaign to boycott your airline.â€” rob delaney (@robdelaney) April 14, 2014(Opens in a new window)

The website Skift.com conducted a timely analysis(Opens in a new window) of the industry's use of Twitter and found that US Airways sends more than 400 tweets per day (all of which are replies), and its average response time is 38 minutes. That's more than 150,000 tweets per year that didn't contain the most offensive image ever sent by a major brand. Those are pretty good odds. And yet, there's that outlier.

US Airways and American Airlines use the software platform SNAP100, according to Skift(Opens in a new window). It's a proprietary tool that doesn't appear to be public-facing.

SNAP is American Airlinesâ€™ proprietary social media tool, and AAâ€™s team uses it for 100% of its Twitter activity. In an effort to up its weak social game, post-merger US Airways recently began tweeting with it too, and it now represents 99.7% of the sister airlineâ€™s activity.

American Airâ€™s social media team declined to answer questions about SNAP, but we know a few things about it from looking at other activity on SkiftIQ. Americanâ€™s response rate to customer issues is faster than any other airline -- 12 minutes. The Airlineâ€™s activity is also 100% devoted to replying to customers. Whatever SNAP specs are, itâ€™s focus is on conversation and customer support.

Still, the incident illustrates the need for Twitter to prove that it's serious in its play to welcome corporate dollars amid all the Bieber fans and breaking news. It needs to provide a better option to help brands safely navigate the real-time landscape, perhaps somehow keeping them away from that inadvertent trigger.

Ever wanted a job in social media? Well, start prepping your rÃ©sumÃ© and cover letter now because @USAirways(Opens in a new window) is about to fire EVERYONE.â€” Eliot Olson (@leftcoastsuit) April 14, 2014(Opens in a new window)

I asked Mashable's senior tech analyst Christina Warren what that all means. Here's what she said:

Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, insert social platform here, were never designed for businesses, but rather for consumers.

Even though businesses now use those tools extensively, the products themselves haven't improved substantially to serve B2C or B2B users. All management systems are in some ways a hack, because they still provide limited functionality and accessibility compared to what you might get for a product designed for use by a large company.

Twitter doesn't make it easy for multiple users to admin a brand account. This case appears to be a pure copy pasta nightmare, but think about all the accidental tweets brands have sent and the various security challenges that occur when tons of people need to access something.

Twitter and Facebook and their ilk obviously don't need to focus on building branded consoles and management tools (that's best left to others for many reasons), but that doesn't mean they can't work to make sure their APIs and data streams are accessible and usable by those third parties.

So, US Airways management, you made the right call by not firing your social media person. He or she made a mistake. That doesn't equate to doing a bad job overall.

The incident that collectively derailed our Mondays should not be considered a fireable offense. The unnamed social soldier was simply using whichever tool that corporate mandated -- and he or she goofed.

Sometimes, that happens to the best of us.

Automattic, which runs the popular blogging service WordPress.com, is in the market for a new round of funding that would value the company at more than $1 billion, according to Fortune(Opens in a new window).

[seealso slug=""teen-feminist""]

Automattic is reportedly seeking $100 to $150 million in funding, roughly six months after Tiger Global Management and Iconiq Capital bought out existing Automattic investor Polaris Capital for $75 million in September. The report from Fortune does not specify who Automattic would be raising from. A company spokesperson declined Mashable's request for comment.

Automattic is a major force in the world of online publishing, thanks to its role in the development of the open-source project, WordPress. WordPress blogs are viewed by more than 400 million(Opens in a new window) people monthly, and users create more than 44 million posts each month. At the service's peak, roughly one year ago in March, that number was more than 49 million monthly posts.

Established news publications such as CNN and GigaOm use WordPress to support their websites.

The new funding is yet another sign that Automattic has no plans to slow down. The company also acquired Longreads, an aggregator of long-form web content, for an undisclosed sum last week.

It's also a sign that while the print-publishing industry seems to be struggling, web publishing is picking up the slack.

If the photo is real, the design looks like many others on the market. However, Amazon is said to be planning custom 3D interface. It wouldn't be the first phone with a 3D-enabled display; 3D phones, including the HTC Evo 3D appeared a few years ago, but they failed to get any traction.

SEE ALSO: 12 Mysterious Google Maps Sightings

The device in the photo is protected by a shell case, most likely to prevent people from seeing the physical design of its body. It's expected to come with six cameras -- four of which are front-facing cameras to help with the software's 3D effects, according to the report.

The cameras will also be used to track the position of the user's face and eyes, so it can alter the positioning and perspective of onscreen objects. That would allow a user to see a 3D image without the need for 3D glasses.

It's rumored to have a Qualcomm Snapdragon processor, 2GB of RAM and will run Amazon's customized version of Android known as Fire OS.

The Wireless Association (CTIA) announced the signing of the ""Anti-Theft Voluntary Commitment"" on Tuesday. Among the signees are Apple, Google, Microsoft, Samsung, Nokia, HTC, Huawei, Motorola, AT&T, Verizon, Sprint, T-Mobile and U.S. Cellular.

The signees agree that new models of smartphones, manufactured after July 2015 and sold in the U.S. will have a pre-loaded or downloadable anti-theft tool.

Furthermore, the tool will prevent reactivation without user's permission (including factory reset attempts), but it will allow the authorized user to reverse the inoperability and restore data in case the phone is recovered.

The initiative comes after several states started considering laws that would make an anti-theft kill switch mandatory for smartphones. In February 2014, California State Sen. Mark Leno proposed a bill that would require manufacturers to install such software on their phones.

7004322,"With Reflection and Resolve, Boston Marks 1 Year Since Bombings","BOSTON, Mass. -- With the barricades along Boylston Street, and grandstands rising above both sides of the finish line, it was possible to -- at least for an innocent moment -- mistake Tuesday for Marathon Monday(Opens in a new window), also known as the Boston Marathon, a joyful April day that is central to Bostonâ€™s identity as a city of grit, determination and camaraderie.

But there were too many signs of the dayâ€™s actual significance -- as the one-year anniversary of the marathon bombings -- to linger in that carefree place for long.

The bombings that took place one year ago killed three spectators: Krystle Campbell, 29, Lu Lingzi, 23, and Martin Richard, 8. The bombs wounded 263 others, and cost more than a dozen to lose some of their limbs.

On Tuesday, the crowds gathered in their usual spots, as if it was the dress rehearsal for the marathon -- except one with completely different emotions than a typical race day. People lined up behind barricades along Boylston Street, just as they do on Marathon Monday, and just as they did last year when Boston's sense of safety and innocence was challenged. The faces I saw on Tuesday were somber, nowhere more so than at the two bombing sites.

Those sites, marked by wreaths protected by honor guards from the military, police and fire departments throughout the Boston area, were places where people paused to reflect and pray throughout the day. Some had visible injuries from the bombings, sporting new limbs. Many more were grappling with invisible scars, from mourning a loved one to coping with a newfound fear of crowds. Laurie LaConte from Beacon Hill, who stopped for a moment near the site of the second explosion, said her daughter is dealing with the emotional repercussions of being very close to one of the explosions last year.

""Thereâ€™s so many horrible things that happened and visible things that happened to people, but there is also a whole other level of people that experienced terror, and theyâ€™re suffering too. And the fact that my daughter is terrified of crowds, I just think that it goes way, way beyond what youâ€™re seeing, and what youâ€™re seeing is bad enough,â€ LaConte said.

Inside the Forum restaurant, which is located just behind the site of the second explosion, the wait staff went about their day as usual. They planned to donate proceeds from the dayâ€™s business to marathon bombing-related charities, but otherwise greeted the anniversary with a steely resolve. Sitting at the bar as the official marathon-tribute ceremony took place down the street, staff reluctantly turned up the television's volume at the request of several patrons.

The employees, it seemed, would have preferred to continue playing the mix of alternative-rock music they had on, than listen to more reminders of the bombings. This makes sense, considering that for them, just showing up for work at their rebuilt restaurant(Opens in a new window) is a daily reminder.

Survivors, some with new legs, gathered at the marathon-tribute ceremony, at which several of those injured by the bombings gave powerful speeches of perseverance, hope and friendship that nearly overshadowed speeches by former Boston mayor Thomas Menino and Vice President Joe Biden.

Patrick Downes, who along with his new wife, lost a leg in the blast(Opens in a new window), expressed his thanks for the tight-knit survivor community. â€œTo our fellow survivor community,â€ he said at the tribute ceremony, â€œWhat would we do without each other?â€

Every speaker echoed the slogan that emerged almost immediately after the attacks: â€œBoston Strong.â€ One local television station, WCVB-TV, even referred to its coverage of Tuesdayâ€™s events as â€œBoston Strong: One Year Later.""

As Menino, who was in office at the time of the bombings, said at the tribute ceremony, Boston's devotion to marathon survivors and victims' families ""will never waver,"" even when the media spotlight is turned off. â€œWhatever you have to do to recover and carry on, know the people of Boston are right there by your side,â€ he said.

""You are strong at this broken place,"" Menino told the crowd. ""The heartbeat of Boston is a mighty force.""

After the ceremony, participants trudged slowly and quietly down Boylston Street in a rainstorm, past the two bombing sites, to a flag-raising ceremony at the finish line. A bell tolled at 2:49 p.m. ET -- the time the bombs detonated -- and silence fell over the crowd, leaving just the sounds of raindrops and rustling umbrellas to fill the void.

The emotions in Boston are still raw one year later, and I suspect they will remain so next week, when thousands will once again line the streets to cheer runners across the marathon finish line.

In the wake of the bombings, and especially on Tuesday, I have wondered what the ""Boston Strong"" slogan really means. For awhile, in the immediate aftermath, it seemed to signify that Boston is too strong of a city to cower in fear; that the terrorists picked the wrong target, as was so eloquently and efficiently expressed(Opens in a new window) by Red Sox slugger David Ortiz soon after the bombings.

It also seemed to refer to the city's unique character, one which is vividly on display each time the marathon is run, and thousands of strangers turn out to cheer on determined runners who struggle to climb Heartbreak Hill in Newton, Mass. There is a mixture of grit, determination and camaraderie that binds Boston together, despite a network of roads that are impossible even for many locals to navigate, a miserable winter climate that feels like it is assaulting you personally, and sports teams that, until recently, went decades without winning the big game.

The marathon is quintessential Boston: an endurance event that rallies the city out of its winter-induced coma, marking the start of spring.

Everyone who grows up in Boston, as I did, has memories of Marathon Monday. As a kid on the North Shore, I watched on television as elite runners and wheelchair athletes set records seemingly every year, their feats of endurance chronicled by breathless sports commentators. Later, like countless Massachusetts residents before me, I was a spectator along the marathon route when my older brother, Brett, as well as a cousin and several friends ran the race to raise money for various causes. That was the year my little brother, Russell, held up a huge sign along the marathon route that said, â€œBrett: Someone Already Won the Marathon.â€

Thatâ€™s vintage Boston sarcasm for you.

Bostonians mourned and reflected on Tuesday. And next Monday, they will reclaim the finish line from the fear that spread from these streets last year.

The arrest comes two days after the CRA first revealed it had experienced a security breach resulting in the loss of taxpayer data.

[seealso slug= ""heartbleed-bug-websites-affected/""]

The 19-year-old man, identified by The Canadian Press(Opens in a new window) as Stephen Arthuro Solis-Reyes of Ontario, was charged with unauthorized use of a computer and mischief in relation to data Tuesday.

A spokesperson for Canada's Western University confirmed to The Canadian Press Solis-Reyes is a computer science student at the school.

The speed with which Canadian authorities tracked down the alleged hacker suggests the attack, though successful, was relatively inexpert.

""They were not a very sophisticated attacker,"" Mark Nunnikhoven, vice-president of cloud and emerging technologies at the software security firm Trend Micro, told The Canadian Press. ""Any attacker worth their salt would have been covering their track a lot better than that.""

The CRA first learned of the security breach Friday, April 11, but didn't inform the public until Monday, at the request of Canadian authorities, according to the report.

Andrew Treusch, the CRA's commissioner, issued a statement(Opens in a new window) Monday informing the public of the breach and detailing the measures the agency is taking to protect citizens:

Regrettably, the CRA has been notified by the Government of Canada's lead security agencies of a malicious breach of taxpayer data that occurred over a six-hour period. Based on our analysis to date, Social Insurance Numbers (SIN) of approximately 900 taxpayers were removed from CRA systems by someone exploiting the Heartbleed vulnerability. We are currently going through the painstaking process of analyzing other fragments of data, some that may relate to businesses, that were also removed.

The CRA is one of many organizations that was vulnerable to Heartbleed, despite our robust controls. Thanks to the dedicated support of Shared Services Canada and our security partners, the Agency was able to contain the infiltration before the systems were restored yesterday. Further, analysis to date indicates no other CRA infiltrations have occurred either before or after this breach.

Beginning today, the Agency is putting in place measures to support and protect the individuals affected by the breach. Each person will receive a registered letter to inform them of the breach. A dedicated 1-800 number has also been set up to provide them with further information, including what steps to take to protect the integrity of their SIN. The Agency will not be calling or emailing individuals to inform them that they have been impacted â€“ we want to ensure that our communications are secure and cannot be exploited by fraudsters through phishing schemes.

The CRA will also provide those who have been affected with access to credit protection services at no cost. And we will apply additional protections to their CRA accounts to prevent any unauthorized activity.

The agency initially suspended online tax filing on its website Tuesday, April 8, as a ""preventive"" measure; the website remained down for five days.

The CRA has extended the deadline for filing taxes due to the closure. The deadline, usually April 30, has been extended to May 5.

Choice Chamber(Opens in a new window) is a crowdsourced game in which online viewers can influence the players' fate during live play as they navigate through a randomly-generated series of puzzle rooms. Viewers on game streaming site Twitch respond to polls in a chat box, which can do anything from trigger new enemies to add power-ups.

This concept will be familiar to anyone who followed the Twitch Plays PokÃ©mon phenomenon in February, when thousands of players simultaneously guided one character all the way through a game of PokÃ©mon Red. The game took 16 days to complete as players sent every possible button command through Twitch's chat box.

A recent study conducted by researchers at Old Dominion University advises adding another task to that checklist: stalking the hopeful employees on Facebook(Opens in a new window). As it turns out, your social media profile knows more about you than you know about yourself.

The study, ""Incremental Validity of Social Media Ratings to Predict Job Performance,"" looked at 146 undergraduate students who were employed outside the university they attended. Each student took an online personality test and agreed to have their social media profiles examined by a team of observers who rated them on a whole suite of characteristics ranging from agreeableness to neuroticism.

Those metrics were then viewed against ratings of each student's performance at work. Study authors Katelyn Cavanaugh and Richard Landers discovered that not only are the personality traits inferred from someone's Facebook profile a significant predictor of their job performance, but these correlations are stronger than those between the results of the self-reported personality test and job performance.

These ratings weren't just a strong predictor of job performance. Judgments of social media profiles also had a stronger correlation with a student's grades than did their self-reported personality tests.

The study's authors speculate social media footprints have an advantage over personality tests because they often contain records of behavior stretching back years and are a relatively uncontrolled environment compared to a one-time personality test.

""This potentially additive value could be because people reveal more honest information through their behaviors represented in Facebook profiles than they do while filling out online forms,"" the authors note. ""Alternately, traits represented in Facebook profiles may be more relevant in an academic or employment situation; Facebook profiles may capture more of the social components required for job performance, or social components that could hinder academic success.""

The results of this study may not come as an enormous shock to a lot of employers, many of whom have been snooping on the profiles of job applicants for years. A 2009 study(Opens in a new window) revealed that 45% of employers admit to using social media to assess job applicants and 35 reported that the information contained in those profiles has caused them to avoid giving offers to some candidates.

Even so, using social media as tool to evaluate potential hires can be highly problematic. A study published late last year in the Journal of Management asked professional recruiters to evaluate the social media profiles of college students who were applying for full-time jobs after graduation. This study failed to find a correlation between the recruiters' ratings and later job performance based on follow-up interviews conducted months later with the now former students' supervisors.

It also found that people who â€Ÿhad traditionally non-White names and/or who were clearly non-White"" tended to receive low ratings. ""Our results suggest that Blacks and Hispanics might be adversely impacted by use of Facebook ratings,"" study author Philip Roth told Forbes(Opens in a new window). (The equally disturbing possibility here is that we'd see the same thing when those recruiters interviewed those people in person.)

Another danger of basing hiring decisions on social media is that looking at someone's Facebook profile could given an employer a piece of information that could leave them open to a lawsuit. For example, if a hiring manager sneaks a peek at a candidate's profile and learns he's gay or holds a specific set of religious beliefs, then doesn't offer the candidate the job, the candidate could sue for discrimination on the basis of religion or sexual orientation.",4/16/2014 0:00,0.532915,5,2,0,4.535826,8,Tech,0,3613.04,2385.514,7233.333,0.415285,0.064609,0.034268,0.018692,0,0,1400
7004002,Your Facebook Friends Really Do Care What You Think! (We Think.),"Your friends actually do care what you think -- or at least Facebook assumes they do.

You may have noticed a relatively new feature on Facebook lately that allows users to ask friends for recommendations or share their own thoughts on topics like movies, TV shows and books with those who ask. You may have missed it when it first rolled out a few months ago; it was a quiet rollout that didn't get the usual attention that a new Facebook feature often generates.

[seealso slug=""news-feed-changes""]

When a user visits a friend's profile and that friend has specified certain ""favorites"" along the lefthand side of said profile, a new button lets users ""ask"" that friend for a recommendation. Facebook first started testing the feature in late 2013.

When a user clicks on the ""ask"" button, a popup appears where that user can request a recommendation for topics like books, TV shows, movies and music. It also allows them to ask other friends for recommendations, too, and the user can add a short message.

A new Ask button appears below a friends favorites on their profile. Credit: Facebook

Clicking the Ask button leads to a pop-up screen where users can add a message and select who they want a recommendation from. Credit: Facebook

Once the request is submitted, the friend receives a notification alerting them that someone is asking for a recommendation. The friend can then select from a list of choices surfaced by Facebook or search for a book or movie that does not appear on the list. The user can also choose to ignore the request.

Once a recommendation request has been made, users can choose from a pre-selected list of recommendations, or search for others. Credit: Facebook

If someone asks you for a recommendation, you will receive a notification where you can act on the request, or ignore it. Credit: Facebook

This type of feature encourages Facebook users to engage more regularly with one another, and also prompts users to add favorite musicians, books and movies to their profile. Facebook isn't sharing any data on how often friends are using the feature (or if more favorites have been added), according to a spokesperson.

Facebook often talks about creating a personalized experience for each user, and in order to do so, needs to know information about that user to surface the most relevant content. A feature like this allows Facebook to better understand a user's likes and dislikes.

The recommend feature is also available on mobile. Users can click on the ""about"" section of a friend's profile, and will find the ""ask"" button when they click on a specific category -- books, music, etc. -- that the friend has populated with her favorites.",4/16/2014 0:00,0.630303,5,1,0,4.324324,4,Business,1414.493,3837.105,3049.599,2750,0.367094,0.042842,0.016216,0.021622,0.5,0.5,892
7024120,Geek Chic? Why Fashion Is Holding Off on Wearables,"After receiving an invitation for this yearâ€™s fifth annual Fashion 2.0 Awards(Opens in a new window), an event that acknowledges the fashion industryâ€™s savviest digital programs and technology outputs, you can imagine my panic in selecting the perfect ensemble.

Finding the perfect outfit

I had nothing in my closet that remotely resembled anything technologically or digitally advanced, unless you count my â€œfollow me(Opens in a new window)â€ tights or my Twitter name necklace. And I knew I showing up wearing my Nike Fuel Bands(Opens in a new window) (yes, plural) or Pebble watch and other gadgetry was just too understated for my aim at high-fashion geek chic.

Credit:

To say I was beyond gleeful would be a massive understatement, and so it wasn't until I arrived at the event that I discovered that no one else shared my enthusiasm for technologically enhanced clothes. Literally. Why was I was the only one dressed up like a Christmas tree? This was the Fashion 2.0 Awards, right?

Where's all the wearable tech?

The ""Wearable Technology"" category awarded Nike Fuel with the most fashionable wearable, but I knew there had to be more, well, fashionable wearables that were left out. Why was that, I wondered?

SEE ALSO: 10 Fresh Apps for Fashion Enthusiasts

Why was it that the fashion industry -- consistently one that prides itself on being cutting edge -- seemed to be missing wearable technology?

I posed this question to Margaux Guerard(Opens in a new window), co-founder and president of MEMI(Opens in a new window), who spoke with Mashable about MEMIâ€™s stylish smart bracelet. The bracelet is geared toward urban women who want to unplug, but stay connected to important calls, using a Bluetooth-enabled iPhone application.

""Fashion is late to the game in wearable technology,"" Guerard said. ""The industry has congratulated innovators in colors, cuts and hemlines for so long that when it comes to technology, there is slow adoption. The jury is still out on wearables, and [labels] have their brand reputation and customer loyalty to protect.""

Guerard knows a thing or two about the brand prospective, having worked as the director of global marketing for Diane von Furstenberg(Opens in a new window) before starting MEMI.

â€œWhen I worked for DVF, we spent a lot of time thinking about how we can protect and preserve the brand. And thatâ€™s important because thatâ€™s how you create prestige and [build] a premium brand.â€

Some people are doing it well

We have seem some major players like Rebecca Minkoff(Opens in a new window) creating the Stelleâ€™ Audio Clutch(Opens in a new window), with a speaker system built in to one of her clutch bags. This yearâ€™s announcement of Tory Burchâ€™s recent partnership with FitBit which will debut this fall as a ""collection of stylish bracelet and pedant accessories(Opens in a new window)"" and Intelâ€™s partnership with Open Ceremony to create a ""smart bracelet(Opens in a new window),""both which are seemingly driven by the technology companies, rather than the fashion houses.

""Wrists, necks, and fingers are very valuable real-estate,"" Guerard said. ""And thatâ€™s a safe place for consumers to play, because they can always take it off if itâ€™s not accepted by their environment.""

There are some very innovative designers and technologists trying to blow the shirt off wearable technology with some racy designs like Studio Roosegaardeâ€™s ""Intimacy"" dress(Opens in a new window) that becomes transparent as the wearerâ€™s heartbeat increases, but mainstream reactions seem to be landing that type of garment in a futuristic space odyssey fashion 3.0 that theyâ€™re just not comfortable with yet.

Yuli Ziv(Opens in a new window), founder of the Fashion 2.0 Awards, says sheâ€™s encouraging her community and attendees to think further into the future, and plan for more innovations to keep up with whatâ€™s possible. She says while it may be uncomfortable for consumers, and even designers now, that doesnâ€™t mean they shouldnâ€™t start planning more advanced applications of technology in their designs down the line.

An industry with a technologically bright future

""I believe this industry is just at the beginning of reaching its potential as something life-changing and revolutionary. There is no reason our clothes wonâ€™t be as functional and durable as some of the gadgets we covet,"" Ziv said.

""If there is anything fashion brands can learn from the iPad, itâ€™s the fact that even today, consumers are willing to pay $700 for a product that is well made and life-changing. And if people are willing to pay $700 for a sexy gadget that does the same thing every desktop does, theyâ€™ll be willing to pay that price for an innovative item of clothing theyâ€™ll wear for years, regardless of seasons and trends. And if brands canâ€™t see where this industry might be in the next 10 or 20 years, getting the next fashion trend right wonâ€™t help them survive.""",4/16/2014 0:00,0.581395,3,1,0,4.813505,4,Business,1414.493,3837.105,3049.599,2076,0.48875,0.035,0.019293,0.012862,0,0,566

Google was selling Glass for $1,500 a pair.

Although the store shut down, it doesn't appear that Google actually sold all of its Glass. Visitors to the site will see ""Out of Stock"" labels on each color, but Google is simply marking them that way -- not necessarily confirming they are sold out.

When Google reports earnings after the market closes on Wednesday, the focus will likely be back on its core business: advertising.

Google is expected to report earnings of $6.40 per share on revenue of $15.52 billion, according to analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters, compared to revenue of $13.97 billion during the same quarter a year earlier.

Analysts are expecting Google to post double-digit percentage growth in advertising revenue this quarter compared to a year earlier. Brian Wieser, an analyst with Pivotal Research Group, wrote in an investor note that he expects total ad revenue to grow by 16%, with display ads up about 30% and search ads up about 10%.

The average cost-per-click for Google ads has been on the decline as more consumers use Google services on mobile devices, which command lower ad rates. In recent months, Google has been working to boost ad spend on mobile with its enhanced campaigns, which may eventually reverse the trend of declining CPC rates by streamlining ad buying across desktop and mobile, but probably not yet.

7004132,Hands On With Apple's CarPlay Integration With Volvo,"Volvo and Apple offered the first public demonstration of CarPlay in the U.S. since its March debut at the Geneva International Motor Show, showing off how the system works during the New York International Auto Show on Wednesday.

Although CarPlay wasn't mounted in a Volvo vehicle, the demonstration unit did show how Volvo's hardware and software integrates seamlessly with the system. Mashable got to go hands-on with CarPlay; here's what we found:

[seealso slug=""apple-carplay-need-to-know""]

Interface dynamics

The first thing we noticed was that touchscreen and application-launch actions were as snappy and smooth as they are on the iPhone, so if you're already familiar with iOS, CarPlay will be a breeze to use.

In fact, CarPlay feels so much like the iPhone experience that the only potential hurdle for those getting accustomed to the in-car system will be remembering that you don't have access to all the functions of a regular iPhone.

Credit: Mashable, Adario Strange

Swiping the screen to change menus was speedy, and switching between applications had no noticeable lag time. In short, if you're already an iPhone lover, as well as a frequent driver, CarPlay will be very hard to resist.

App performance

The Siri voice integration worked as advertised, giving us instant access to Apple Maps, the phone, messages and music. Bringing up Maps via voice was easy, and as long as you have your location option set to ""on"" in your iPhone's privacy settings, the CarPlay map will default to your current location when you open the app.

Credit: Mashable, Adario Strange

But it's when you ask for directions that you see the true mobile power of CarPlay. After requesting directions to a location in Manhattan, Siri presented several options on the CarPlay interface. Select one, and you are presented with a detailed, turn-by-turn routing map, complete with the 3D-buildings option in Apple's iPhone Maps app.

Making a call was just a matter of pushing the Siri button (which will be accessible via the steering wheel), and saying, ""Call John Doe."" After Siri acknowledges the command, the call is immediately put through. The same ease of use was present when sending messages.

And those familiar with that satisfying ""ting"" sound when you get a new message, will be happy to know that it's also present in CarPlay. However, if the message includes an image, you won't see it onscreen, and Siri won't tell you that an image has been included, in order to adhere to road-safety guidelines.

But is it safe to use?

While using CarPlay, I noticed that although I didn't need to look at the screen, I was nevertheless compelled to, simply because it's an attractive display with amazing graphics.

The issue of safety and distracted driving will likely come up more often, as these interactive screens begin to claim more dashboard real estate even in affordable cars. Both Volvo and Apple said distracted driving is something they're both actively working to prevent.

""We work very hard ahead of time with all the car companies, including, of course, Volvo, on the specifics of the user interface,"" Stephen Chick, a member of Apple's CarPlay team, said. ""The whole point of CarPlay is to have a safe environment in the car for your iPhone. That's the experience we want to bring because we realize that using your iPhone itself is not the way that we want to go in the car.""

Ready for the road

Overall, CarPlay was very easy to use, and just as intuitive as an iPad or iPhone; this virtually erases the learning curve, and gives Apple's in-car system a leg up over competing systems with less familiar interfaces.

Credit: Mashable, Adario Strange

Couple that with the fact that aftermarket CarPlay options from Pioneer will soon be available, and suddenly it becomes apparent just how powerful Apple's in-car system could become in a very short span of time. Chick added that other aftermarket CarPlay options will be revealed in the coming months.

Volvo's first car to include Apple's CarPlay will be the Volvo XC90(Opens in a new window) SUV, which is slated to debut later this year.

7024040,A Short History of Obama's Evolving Stance on Gay Marriage,"President Barack Obama will be remembered for a host of reasons when he steps down from office at the beginning of 2017 -- collaring Osama bin Laden, passing the Affordable Care Act -- but a prominent reason is likely to be his ""evolving"" stance on gay marriage.

In an age when 59% of the American public now supports same-sex marriage(Opens in a new window) -- a drastic shift in favor of gay rights over the last few years -- anything the president has uttered on the subject has garnered attention. Publicly, he's said that his stance on the matter grew into one of support. Privately, that doesn't quite add up(Opens in a new window).

In an article published Wednesday titled ""How the President Got to 'I Do' on Gay Marriage(Opens in a new window),' New York Times reporter Jo Becker has adapted part of her book, Forcing the Spring: Inside the Fight for Marriage Equality(Opens in a new window), to show how Obama came to accept marriage equality.

Below, we've pulled out some of the highlights.

Public Perception

In 1996, Obama filled out a questionnaire saying he supported same-sex marriage. But when he ran for Congress four years later, he had shifted to ""undecided,"" according to the Times. Eight years after that, as he was campaigning for his first term as president, he was opposed.

Despite the public shift, the Times(Opens in a new window) quotes White House advisor David Axelrod as saying that Obama ""has never been comfortable with his position."" No insider actually thought he opposed same-sex marriage.

Private Perception

No matter his private stance, his public verbiage weighed on those close to him. First Lady Michelle Obama wanted him to come out in favor of same-sex marriage, in part because she thought his endorsement would lead a change in public opinion.

According to the Times(Opens in a new window), the president also knew that his decision not to publicly support same-sex marriage was ""a source of disappointment"" for people who otherwise got along fine with the president.

Pushing the Envelope

Obama's ""evolving"" stance was known by the time Chad Griffin, a political operative and strong same-sex rights advocate, met the president at a fundraiser in Washington in April 2011.

â€œMr. President,â€ Griffin said, according to the New York Times(Opens in a new window) â€œhow can we help you evolve more quickly?â€

The president said ""you can tell from what I have done so far the direction that I am headed,"" sort of a way to say, 'hey, I'm trying.' He'd helped repeal ""don't ask, don't tell,"" a military policy that prevented gay men and lesbian women from serving openly, and his White House was no longer associated with the Defense of Marriage Act, which prevented same-sex couples from getting federal marital benefits even if their union was legal in their home state.

Plus, at that time, his reelection campaign was concerned about what public support for same-sex marriage would mean for his shot at a second term.

Along Came Biden

Vice President Joe Biden has long been known to say things off-the-cuff, especially if those things happen to be his personal beliefs.

Griffin, the political operative, was in Los Angeles at a gathering of gay Democrats who were about to meet Biden in April of 2012. And again it was Griffin who pushed ahead.

""I wonder if you can just sort of talk in a frank, honest way about your own personal views as it relates to equality, but specifically as it relates to marriage equality,"" he said, according to the Times(Opens in a new window).

Biden, clearly uncomfortable, had held the same stance as Obama for as long as they'd been on the same political ticket. But that day he called same-sex marriage equality ""inevitable,"" and said it was the White House's job to make sure it happened. Days later, he reiterated that position on Meet the Press.

Forcing His Hand

Obama's advisors had long been caught up in a debate over how politically damaging it would be to come out in support of same-sex marriage and how damaging it would be to not come out in favor of it. But after Biden's comment, Obama had little choice.

In an interview with Robin Roberts of Good Morning America in May, 2012, Obama said that, as a personal ideal, he thought same-sex couples should be allowed to marry.

Months later, at his second inauguration, Obama was more forceful. He drew a direct comparison from the civil rights movement to the discrimination that gay couples now face.

â€œOur journey is not complete until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law,â€ he said, according to the Times(Opens in a new window). â€œFor if we are truly created equal, then surely the love we commit to one another must be equal as well.â€",4/16/2014 0:00,0.422062,15,12,0,4.640553,10,00000,0,6607.536,3522.761,2800,0.568841,0.322464,0.039171,0.009217,0.45,0.3,5000
7004083,Honda's ASIMO Robot Is Now Surprisingly Human,"Honda's remarkable humanoid robot, ASIMO, has come a long way since I first saw it stiffly walk across a stage more than a decade ago.

The latest edition can run briskly, climb stairs with ease, dance like Travolta, kick a ball and jump up in down in what can only be described as a robot tantrum.

Honda's ASIMO raises its arms. Credit: Mashable / Christina Ascani

The 4 feet tall, 115-pound robot now features five dextrous fingers on each hand with force feedback sensors. As we saw in its first North America demonstration at the International Auto Show in New York on Wednesday, ASIMO can pick up a sealed container filled with orange juice, unscrew the top, pick up a paper up with its other hand, pour the juice and carefully set both cup and container back on the table.

It's a simple task for humans. For ASIMO, it takes a great deal of sensors, including its two camera eyes and the sensors in its hands -- which not only tell the robot that it's holding something, but what kind of object it is and how much it weighs.

Earlier versions of ASIMO were somewhat larger and heavier, but this robot has a far greater degree of autonomy.

When I first saw ASIMO (which stands for ""Advanced Step in

Innovative Mobilityâ€) in 2003, the robot was remote controlled from behind the stage. Now the engineers program it with simple tasks -- and ASIMO uses its sensors figures out the rest.

It can navigate a floor, labeled with tape so ASIMO can keep track of where it's going. It can walk up a flight of steps without pausing (or falling(Opens in a new window)). ASIMO still has to pause before descending the steps (it kind of stomps down them).

ASIMO's robot feet can handle, running, stairs, kickball and an uneven surface. Credit: Mashable / Christina Ascani

The robot's battery still doesn't last more than 40 minutes, and ASIMO has an unfortunate habit of walking in a semi-crouch. But it can now also jump in place and hop on one foot. Neither of these actions look super smooth, and seem unimpressive until you realize you're judging a man-made object by human standards.

It's a robot that can jump, not a person jumping while wearing a robot suit.

ASIMO's hands are so articulate that they can know perform sign language. Credit: Mashable / Christina Ascani

Honda, which started the ASIMO project in 1986, is spending a lot of time working on ASIMO's communication skills. The robot can understand a handful of phrases and is now quite adept, thanks to its articulated hands, at Japanese sign language. Honda executive Jeffrey Smith told us that ASIMO is in the process of learning American Sign Language.

[img src=""http://admin.mashable.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/ASIMO_Robot_Honda_040.jpg"" caption=""ASIMO's robot face includes to camera ""eyes"" and a smile, barely visible under its trademark visor."" credit=""Mashable / Christina Ascani"" alt=""ASIMO_Robot_Honda_040""]

Best know for making cars, Honda, is working hard on removing the ""creepiness"" factor from ASIMO, a task that becomes increasingly important -- and perhaps difficult -- as ASIMO becomes more and more human-like and starts to approach the uncanny valley.

ASIMO, for example, can serve tea -- but instead of focusing the robot entirely on the task of delivering and pouring hot liquid, Honda has programmed ASIMO to pause and look at the guests before bending down and placing the tea on the table. That simple act, which mimics what a human might do, ""helps people have more friendliness and affinity toward ASIMO,"" explained one Honda executive through an interpreter.

It's also critical that ASIMO, which can now recognize faces and vocal commands, also read our non-verbal communication. Honda researchers hope to build this skill by placing ASIMO in more real-world situations, where they can collect additional data.

In our brief time with ASIMO, the robot showed off all its skills, including running across the stage at nearly 3 miles an hour; it even shook my hand. As I held its cool, magnesium alloy appendage and felt it firmly, yet gently, pump my hand, I imagined a not-too-distant future where a robot like ASIMO is carrying my luggage, fetching a ginger ale from the fridge, or keeping my children entertained with a game of soccer.

For now, though, ASIMO remains an impressive piece of robotic technology -- one that, like a favorite aunt, visits far too infrequently and has no timetable for a lengthier or permanent stay.",4/16/2014 0:00,0.553288,14,1,0,4.944812,9,00000,1418.69,3613.04,2294.898,2445,0.406002,0.052551,0.03532,0.013245,0,0,711
7024059,Brands You Follow on Instagram Are Watching You Verrrry Closely,"The brands you follow on Instagram may be paying close attention to you -- very close attention, in fact.

Union Metrics(Opens in a new window), the social analytics company behind the Twitter analytics service TweetReach, added an Instagram analytics tool on Wednesday. A major benefit to Union Metrics' customers is the ability to get detailed information about the followers who interact with its posts.

[seealso slug=""girly-instagram-accounts""]

The new analytics offering includes what Union Metrics calls ""detailed participant reporting,"" a tool that allows brands to identify their biggest fans within Instagram. Brands will be able to create timelines depicting the comments and likes from each fan, a heat map of when each fan comments and likes, and breakdowns of how often those fans engage with the brand.

In essence, brands will be able to pinpoint their biggest fans, helping them plan and execute their Instagram strategy.

""A deeper understanding of your fans and the people that are participating in your conversation really helps you to target your content,"" Hayes Davis, CEO of Union Metrics, told Mashable. ""There is no such thing as too much understanding of your audience.""

This is an approach shared by another Instagram analytics firm, Curalate, which also works to identify the most active participants for its clients. Curalate even helps its clients identify popular photos its fans are sharing, so those brands can share those photos on the brand website. It's yet another way brands are hoping to make a personal connection with their followers.

Union Metrics only looks at users' public data in relation to brands, Davis said, not their private information. ""It's important for us to treat people's public data with respect,"" he added.

These general Instagram analytics tools are not entirely new. Union Metrics joins a handful of other providers who already offer similar products, including Curalate, Simply Measured and Nitrogram. Another analytics offering, Statigram, even offers a free service to users.

This wealth of interest in Instagram is yet another example of the importance of social data With Facebook and Twitter, that value seems obvious. The social platforms offer brands millions of users in exchange for millions in big-time ad spending. Advertising can be costly on social media -- Facebook's new video ads fetched more than $600,000 per day, for example -- so finding the right audience is key.

On Instagram, advertising is still very new, and few companies have had the opportunity to test Instagram ads. Using analytics tools to monitor organic reach or posts that brands don't pay for extra exposure is a good stepping stone before committing big money on what is still a relatively unfamiliar platform, Davis said.

""A brand will be most successful advertising on a social platform it already understands, so it's a great idea for brands to learn more about what organic content performs well on a particular platform before committing to a larger ad spend there,"" he explained.

It may still be early for Instagram ads, but you can bet that when the company opens the door, brands will be ready.",4/16/2014 0:00,0.53012,11,3,0,4.738095,8,00000,0,6549.778,2584.914,34233.33,0.389918,-0.05751,0.016667,0.02381,0,0,1500

Dotcom, the founder of the defunct file-sharing website Megaupload, had cars, cash and other property seized from his New Zealand home under a restraining order made by the United States District Court in January of 2012 for copyright fraud, The New Zealand Herald reports(Opens in a new window). Among the property seized was $6 million in luxury cars.

Ever since the raid, Dotcom has been tangled in a long and hard-fought legal battle against both the New Zealand and the U.S governments.

Two men showed up, and began taking pictures and writing notes the day after the ad went up, the The Guardian(Opens in a new window) reported. They then entered the salon, and asked who was responsible for the ad, reportedly claiming that it was disrespectful and had to come down.

The 32-year-old Donovan has played so much soccer, in fact, that he took a self-imposed three-month hiatus from the game early last year to rest up and recharge before returning to the pitch just over a year go. Now the L.A. Galaxy star says he's ready for the 2014 World Cup -- which will be his fourth -- in Brazil this summer.

[seealso url = ""http://mashable.com/2014/03/30/world-cup-usmnt-mls-players""]

They landed in the World Cup's ""Group of Death"" alongside powerhouse Germany, hyper-talented Portugal and always-tricky Ghana (which has eliminated the USMNT from the last two World Cups).

This week, with less than two months to go until the World Cup kicks off on June 12, Donovan caught up with Mashable to chat over the phone. We talked about the USMNT's prospects in Brazil, the evolution of soccer Stateside and worldwide, the last-minute goal he scored against Algeria to push the U.S. through to the knockout stage of the 2010 World Cup -- and much more.

What follows is a lightly edited transcript of our conversation.

Q&A With Landon Donovan

Mashable: The group you guys landed in for this World Cup certainly is daunting in many ways. But what are the things you feel good about -- either advantages you might have on the field or off-the-pitch things that might work in your favor?

Donovan: How many teams get to play Ghana, Portugal and Germany in one World Cup? We're excited about the opportunity, as daunting as it might seem. It's a great opportunity. We have a lot of guys that have been here before and understand what it takes, and we have a few guys that are young and hungry for an opportunity they've never had before. It's going to be a great experience.

I think we're certainly capable of beating all those teams. That doesn't mean it happens or it's easy, but we're absolutely capable of it. We feel like we have a very real chance.

Let's scout the competition beyond Group G. Who do you think are the favorites in Brazil, and who do you think could make a dark-horse run?

Well, I certainly hope the U.S. in in there. I think it would be hard to bet against Brazil in a World Cup in Brazil. There will be a lot of pressure on them, but they're certainly good enough to win. Argentina is a very good team, and Germany, too. A team that some people talk about but not everyone knows about is Belgium. Talent-wise, when you just look at their players, I think they're as good as any team in the world.

You scored that incredible late goal against Algeria to put the U.S. into the knockout stage in 2010, then videos of people reacting really went viral. But no one else on Earth can watch those reaction clips from the same perspective as you. How did you first come across them and what was it like watching them for the first time?

I found out about the videos the very next morning -- that's the beauty of social media these days. But honestly, I just look at it the same way anyone else would. I just look at it as a fan, so it's fun for me. Being in the moment and watching the replay or reactions online are two completely different things. In the moment it was all about just doing what I could to help the team win -- that's my job. After, it was about enjoying and appreciating the whole play coming together. Almost everyone was involved in it in one way or another. It was the ultimate team goal.

It was such an incredible fan moment though. People must bring it up to you all the time when they see you in public, right?

People do have a lot of cool stories around it. ""I was with my son,"" or ""I was with my grandma, who's since passed away."" Just really cool stories. It's fun to hear them all and understand that you affected people in that way.

Julian Green has been a hot topic among USMNT fans since the 18-year-old Bayern Munich player committed his international future to the U.S. over Germany last month. But very few people here have really seen him play. You got a good look at him training for this month's friendly against Mexico. What does he do well and what does he need to improve on?

I think he has a good starting point. He moves well, and technically he's gifted. He has good feet and some good pace. So it seems like he's going to be a good player. But I'm a little cautious, because we've been a little fast to anoint good young players in this country when they come up.

So I'd like to give him some time to develop. That's for good and bad -- you can let him grow that way, and if he doesn't pan out then you didn't build him up for no reason. I hope he gets some games with Bayern or wherever else he might end up. But eventually it does seem like he'll be a very good player for the national team going forward.

Fair or not though, a lot of the questions many fans have are about what he might be able to add this summer. Do you think he can contribute to the team in Brazil?

Fortunately, I don't have to make those decisions. (Laughs) But I did think he held his own in camp before the Mexico match. At some point, what he needs is to just play in more games. The only time you're going to tell if he's really capable is when he plays in more games, at whatever level that is. So I hope he gets to do that and keep improving.

You're lined up to play in your fourth World Cup this summer. Have you thought one way or another about it being your last?

I haven't made any decision definitively. But from a physical standpoint, the game is so much faster now than it's ever been, and one of my greatest attributes is my ability to run and my speed. As you get older, that sort of tails off. It's not that I don't think I'll be capable, but it might be more difficult at 36 to keep moving the same way. So we'll see.

How have you seen soccer change or evolve as a sport since you've been a pro and even going back to when you were a kid?

I think it's becoming more and more of a young man's game. It's just so much faster and more dynamic than ever. I think what you're going to see here soon is that you're going to have to start backing off a bit more in training because the games are so intense and demanding that you need a lot of the week just to recover.

Ten or 20 years ago you could train all week really hard and play that one game a week and it'd be fine. But with the amount of games and the speed of the game overall, I don't think that mentality can last. Players will just break down.

Is this just a higher caliber of athlete playing the sport, or what do you think this is the result of?

It's that, but it's other things too. Ten years ago we didn't have the same nutritional knowledge and we couldn't track training habits as well. Now you have everything at the touch of your fingertips. Teams are doing all the right things for recovery -- from ice baths, to treatments, to doctors -- and then we're also just developing better players all over the world.

What about in the States? The game has really boomed here since you first joined the national team. Where do you think American soccer is now and what do you think it needs to keep improving?

(Laughs) It sort of makes realize how long I've been around. I've seen some pretty dark days in soccer in this country, where you almost weren't sure if MLS was going to stick around. So to see where it is now is truly remarkable. As far as the national team, we keep getting better, talent-wise. But we have to make sure we advance in other areas too, having smart and clever players as well as physically talented ones so that we can really compete with the best teams one day.

As a fan of the sport, what teams do you like watching the most?

I still follow Everton closely, because of the time I spent there. And obviously it seems most people love watching FC Barcelona play as a whole. Those would be my two answers, for the most part.

Favorite players? Or is that too hard to say, given that they're also competition?

I like watching Cristiano play. Gareth Bale, too. Yaya Toure -- I think he's a great player. I like watching Sergio Aguero. That's a good start, but there are so many more guys I like watching too.

Samsung's Galaxy 11 premise is clever -- a dream-team match for the future of Earth. You're on that team with Cristiano, Messi -- it's stacked. Would you guys just cakewalk to the World Cup title this summer if you competed there together?

(Laughs) No matter who you have, it'd be hard for any squad to go out and win the World Cup on just talent. But when you look at that group, there are some older, veteran leaders too -- guys who would be really fun to play with. So we'd have a good shot.

Actually, maybe they should do that -- have it where players make their own teams from all over the world. There could even be a draft. How fun would that be?

Dude, I'd pay anything to watch that.",4/16/2014 0:00,0.587719,2,10,0,4.754167,9,00000,0,9673.071,4909.618,1500,0.641667,-0.21181,0.008333,0.0375,1,-0.5,3300
7004134,LinkedIn's Mobile March Continues With New SlideShare App,"The newest addition to LinkedIn's growing collection of mobile apps is here: one for SlideShare, the company it bought for $119 in 2012.

This is the first mobile app for SlideShare; it allows users to scroll through a feed of slideshows and presentations uploaded by those they follow and connect with.

[seealso slug=""linkedin-internal-job-posting""]

The feed on the Android app is personalized, meaning users can subscribe to certain categories like tech, finance, or news and politics. To view a slideshow, a user can swipe left or right to move between slides without ever leaving the feed. Users can also save or like slideshows, then come back to them later.

Almost half of LinkedIn's traffic comes via mobile (41%), and the company expects that number to reach 50% sometime in 2014. SlideShare is contributing to this figure; the company says that mobile views on SlideShare increased 223% last year.

The SlideShare app is LinkedIn's fifth app, and operates along the lines of LinkedIn's news reader app, Pulse, which also surfaces content based on categories and publications that users subscribe to. On SlideShare, selecting categories to follow is the first thing users do when opening the app.

SlideShare released its first app on Wednesday, which allows users to view slideshows and presentations on their phones. Credit: SlideShare

Mashable reported that a new app was in the works from LinkedIn last week, but executives at the company were not specific on details. LinkedIn has adopted a ""multi-app strategy,"" similar to Facebook's; the company plans to release a suite of standalone applications in hopes of capturing the attention of an users who are rapidly moving to mobile.

LinkedIn's strategy around standalone apps focuses on one word: simplicity. The company tries to take its popular, existing services and build them out into mobile experiences, explained Parker Barrile, LinkedIn's VP of product for LinkedIn Talent Solutions, last week.

â€œMobile apps work best when they are very focused on one specific use case or value proposition,"" Barrile added. ""So whenever we see a use case among our members that we believe is meaningful enough or broadly based enough to merit its own app, weâ€™ll build that app.â€

For now, SlideShare is only available on Android, which you can download here(Opens in a new window). iOS users can sign up to be a beta tester for an iOS app, which is also in the works. Along with the app, SlideShare updated its mobile web version, allowing users to swipe between presentation slides.

""There are no prospects for the restart of the business,"" Chief Executive Officer Mark Karpeles said in a statement(Opens in a new window) on the company's website. The Tokyo(Opens in a new window) District Court dismissed the application for civil rehabilitation Wednesday and appointed an administrator of the company's assets in place of Karpeles.

Mt. Gox, based in Tokyo, filed for bankruptcy protection(Opens in a new window) on Feb. 28, saying it lost 850,000 bitcoins then worth about $500 million. It has since recovered about 200,000. The collapse roiled the bitcoin market, which has also faced recent hurdles such as China(Opens in a new window) banning banks from dealing in the digital assets and the U.S. government's decision to tax them.

The administrator, lawyer Nobuaki Kobayashi, said in a separate statement(Opens in a new window) that the court will probably order the start of bankruptcy proceedings. How the company is treated will be decided by taking into account factors including whether there is any candidate to buy the business, Kobayashi said.

The bitcoin exchange, once the world's largest, said in its Feb. 28 filing that its debt exceeded assets by 2.7 billion yen ($26 million) and about 2.8 billion yen was also missing from its bank accounts.

7004126,Facebook's News Feed: What Changed and Why,"As Winston Churchill once said, â€œto improve is to change; to be perfect is to change often."" It's a maxim Facebook seems to have adopted wholeheartedly when it comes to the News Feed.

Posts appearing in your news feed today likely look different from the posts you saw six months ago, both in appearance and content. The simple reason for this is Facebook is learning more about you, and that means the company's news feed algorithm is better at determining what you like and what you dislike.

[seealso slug=""facebook-news-feed-curation""]

The average Facebook user has roughly 1,500 stories per day that could appear in their news feed. Facebook surfaces about 20% of those stories. That's where the algorithm comes in, and that's why Facebook is constantly tweaking it.

The social network has been particularly busy with the News Feed the past six months, releasing a number of algorithm updates and a significant redesign. It's all part of CEO Mark Zuckerberg's ultimate goal for the product: to provide every user with a perfectly personalized digital newspaper.

What exactly has changed in the News Feed algorithm in recent months, and why? Here's everything you need to know.

What You're Seeing More Of:

Auto-play Videos (Including Ads)

Facebook first tested auto-play videos in the mobile News Feed in September. Facebook's web version got auto-play videos in December. The company began testing auto-play video ads a week later, but postponed full implementation. In March, Facebook announced auto-play video ads would begin to roll out to all users over the ""next few months.""

That means some of you know the ads all too well. But if you're thinking ""auto-play ads? Never seen one"", then rest assured, you will.

These videos play automatically as you scroll through your News Feed. They won't have any sound unless a user clicks on them. This does not include shared videos from third party sites, like YouTube, but only videos uploaded directly to Facebook.

What do you think of auto-play video ads in your Facebook News Feed?(Opens in a new window)

Larger Photos

Facebook began to include larger images in the News Feed as part of the platform's redesign announced in March. Photos now span the entire width of the News Feed.

This larger photo feature was about the only one of a set of News Feed changes promised back in March 2013 that actually arrived. We were promised tabs and multiple feeds that users could subscribe to; none have surfaced so far. The only other change from this round worth noting: the default font changed slightly.

High Quality News Stories

Facebook altered its news feed algorithm in December in order to surface more ""high quality content"" on the platform. That means more news and current events, according to the company's blog.

This change affected the News Feed in both its desktop and mobile versions, although Facebook says mobile users should notice the greater difference. The company hopes to be a competitor to Twitter when it comes to breaking news and the social conversations that result from it. This is also the reason you may notice more ...

Resurfaced Content

As part of the algorithm change that surfaces more ""high quality"" content, Facebook really wants to make sure you saw those stories -- to the point where they will pop up even if you've read them. That may be annoying for some users, but the social network really wants to make sure you're not missing a conversation your friends might be having around those hot-button articles.

Here's Facebook's explanation for the change, courtesy of the company blog(Opens in a new window): ""After people read a story, they are unlikely to go back and find that story again to see what their friends were saying about it, and it wouldnâ€™t bump up in News Feed. With this update, stories will occasionally resurface that have new comments from friends.""

Still, users complain about seeing the same content over and over. Our recommendation: Like the stuff you want to see more of, and either don't engage with or hide the posts you don't enjoy (via a drop-down menu next to the name of whomever posted it). Be aware that if you hide a post, you're less likely to see any posts from that person.

More Content from Brands

Facebook made another small algorithm tweak in February to help brands expand their audience: if a brand tags another brand in a post, their content can now reach fans of both brand pages.

For example, if McDonald's mentions its partnership with NBA star LeBron James, and tags him in the post (as they did below), that post may now appear in news feed for fans of either McDonalds or LeBron. It's a simple way for brands to expand reach, and may mean more brand content in your feed.

What You're Seeing Less Of:

'Meme photos'

When Facebook decided to highlight more ""high quality"" content within news feed, there was a necessary corollary: less low quality stuff. What counts as low quality? Facebook has been frustratingly imprecise in its definition, except to say that it's not singling out any particular website for demotion.

One example of demoted content the social network gave in this AllThingsD(Opens in a new window) interview late last year: ""meme photos.""

""itâ€™s not like youâ€™re never going to see a funny cat photo from Imgur,"" said News Feed manager Lars Backstrom. ""Itâ€™s that maybe youâ€™ll see 10 percent less of that, and 10 percent more articles.""

'Spammy' Links

Have you ever clicked on a link that takes you to a page full of ads? There are a lot of four-letter words you may use to refer to these links, especially if you get duped into clicking on one, but Facebook is choosing to call them ""spammy"" -- and wants to eliminate them from news feed.

The company announced an algorithm tweak last week that will identify posts with ""spammy links"" and keep them from surfacing to other users. Facebook says that when users visit a link and fail to Like or share the original post, it tends to be spammy. Its not a perfect system, of course, but we appreciate the attempt.

Like-baiting

If a post asks you to Like, share or comment, it's gaming the Facebook system. That type of engagement is what helps identify the good posts from the bad posts. The company is trying to put a stop to the posts that actively asks users to Like it.

An example of Like-baiting. Credit: Facebook

This was part of the algorithm change announced last week, so you may not notice much of a difference yet. You can also do your part to keep Like-baiting stories away from your friends: hide them.

Ultimately, you have more control over what you see in the News Feed than you may think. The best way to ensure you see what you care about is to engage with the posts you like best (Like, comment, or share them) and hide the ones you don't.",4/16/2014 0:00,0.485944,11,1,0,4.79,9,00000,1550.286,4365.207,2823.606,1100,0.293894,0.024818,0.01,0.008,0,0,1600

The Los Angeles Kings and Anaheim Ducks are the only two teams in the playoff field that don't have a fan majority in any state. Could this be because they split loyalties in Southern California? Perhaps, but the San Jose Sharks -- located a few hundred miles north -- rule both California and Oregon.

The Colorado Avalanche pretty much run the middle of the country.

The Chicago Blackhawks own the most territories, with a majority in 10 states. The Pittsburgh Penguins are next, with nine territories made up of six states and three Canadian provinces.

Alaska is closer to Canada than any other part of the U.S. So who rules there? The Detroit Red Wings. Go figure.

On hand to introduce the vehicle to the American public was Nissan's senior vice president and chief creative officer, Shiro Nakamura.

[seealso slug=""nissan-plans-to-offer-driverless-cars-by-2020""]

According Nissan, the slightly futuristic design aesthetic of the 2015 Murano is inspired by the Nissan Resonance concept vehicle(Opens in a new window) unveiled back in 2013.

""At Nissan, we create concept vehicles with an eye toward production, rather than just for entertaining auto show audiences,"" says Nakamura. ""Likely few people who saw Resonance in its North American International Auto Show debut imagined that we could build such a futuristic design. But here it is, ready to hit Nissan showrooms less than 24 months later.â€

Nevertheless, fans of the old version of the Murano aren't necessarily in for any major culture shock, as the vehicle's new accents are really only a slight departure from its predecessor.

The new Murano's most noticeable nod to the Resonance concept is at the rear, where the rectangular exhaust and extending curved tail lights definitely give the normally conservative looking vehicle a bit of design whimsy. The front of the vehicle, particularly the headlight design, also mirrors the aggressive lines present in the Resonance concept.

And, in case you aren't getting the ""futuristic"" message, Nissan also claims that the new Murano's ""zero gravity"" seats, which include embedded USB ports, are directly inspired by NASA. The vehicle also features safety system also offers predictive forward collision warnings, cross-traffic alerts and an around view monitor.

We block distracting websites. We try meticulous to-do lists to help us prioritize the tasks we donâ€™t really want to do. And -- perhaps most commonly -- we give ourselves fake deadlines to pressure ourselves into doing said tasks.

Well, Iâ€™ve got some bad news for you. Recent research(Opens in a new window) suggests that self-imposed deadlines simply donâ€™t work.

In the study, researchers Alberto Bisin and Kyle Hyndman asked three groups of students to alphabetize three word jumbles, telling them they would receive $15 for each jumble completed on time. The first group of participants were given evenly spaced deadlines for each jumble, the second group a final deadline for all the jumbles, and the third allowed to set their own deadlines.

The results? Those who had set their own deadlines completed fewer jumbles than any other group. Researchers and procrastination experts believe that this is because the authority of the deadline isnâ€™t there when itâ€™s self-imposed, and therefore the motivation to actually get it done never comes. As reported by Eric Jaffe of Fast Company(Opens in a new window):

If time management were the essence of the problem, a self-imposed deadline should help.

7023827,Seat-Belt Protest on Swedish Flight Halts Deportation of Iranian Man,"A quiet protest on board a plane in Sweden prevented an Iranian man from being deported back to his home country.

Passengers on a flight scheduled to leave Ã–stersund for Stockholm last week refused to buckle their seat belts after activists handed out pamphlets against the deportation of Ghader Ghalamere. Pilots had no choice but to cancel the flight, since passengers must buckle up before a plane can legally take off.

Ghalamere has two children with his wife Fatemah, a resident of Sweden, according to The Independent(Opens in a new window). Ghalamere has been in the process of trying to become a Swedish resident himself, but Swedish law requires that he apply outside the country. He tried and failed in Norway, and upon his return, the Swedish Migration Board told Ghalamere that it would have to deport him back to Iran, where he could reapply.

But going back to Iran could prove quite problematic for Ghalamere. He was a member of the Kurdish Democratic Party(Opens in a new window) that fought against the Iranian government with a guerrilla army in Northern Iraq. He first fled to Turkey ""years ago,"" according to The Independent, where he met his wife, and was declared a refugee by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Now, Ghalamere fears a return to Iran would result in imprisonment and death.

Once everyone had boarded the plane, one of Ghalamere's supporters asked everyone to leave their seat belts unfastened(Opens in a new window), according to Radio Sweden. Malin BjÃ¶rk, a candidate in the upcoming European Parliament elections, was also on board, and reportedly urged passengers not to buckle their belts.

""The only thing we could do was to protest in a dignified manner,"" BjÃ¶rk told Radio Sweden(Opens in a new window).

After spending a ""long time(Opens in a new window)"" on the tarmac, an unidentified man boarded the plane, and spoke to the crew; the flight was then cancelled. Ghalamere was taken back to a detention center in GÃ¤vle by the Swedish Migration Board, about 4.5 hours away from Ã–stersund by car.

An organization called the Network of Refugee Support Groups organized a protest in both GÃ¤vle and Ã–stersund to try to attract more attention to Ghalamere's cause.

6866766,Witness Friends' Reactions to Your Photos With This App,"Sharing moments with friends and family just got a little more personal with Reactr(Opens in a new window), an app that captures a userâ€™s reaction after sharing a photo or video with him or her.

A Reactr user sends a picture, video or text message to a friend. Before sending it, they choose the type of reaction they want to receive from the friend -â€“ either a recorded video or photo. The friend then opens up the app, chooses whether they want to share their reaction, and if they do, the reaction is sent back to the user.

The reaction app, similar to others such as React Messenger and Samba, connects people visually with the messages they send.

â€œThe idea for Reactr came after I had sent a funny picture to my friends only to receive countless 'Haha,' 'OMG' and 'LOL' responses,â€ Ash Gilpin, the inventor of Reactr and President of Eyepinch, Inc., told The Unofficial Apple Weblog (TUAW)(Opens in a new window). â€œI realized I was missing out on some priceless reactions. Reactr provides a platform for allowing a more natural form of interaction between people, through photos and videos.â€

While methods for getting a reaction already exist, like Snapchat or simply calling a friend to see what they thought of your text or photo, the company believes it goes beyond these forms of communications. Sending a photo isn't the end game -â€“ seeing the reaction is, which brings friendships, especially long-distance ones, closer.

""Sure, you could always send something to a friend using traditional methods and then follow up with a 'what did you think?' text,"" said Gilpin in an emailed statement to Mashable. ""However, thatâ€™s what people have been forced to do all this time. We want to change all that. We believe such a change is needed and wanted.""

Currently in its second version, Reactr wants to reach the next level of social media sharing. ""There are many photo-sharing apps on the market, but Reactr is one of a kind,"" said Gilpin in a press release(Opens in a new window). ""No other app captures someone's reaction. It really adds a new dimension to sharing photos and capturing priceless moments otherwise lost.""

Regarding privacy, a user can always decide if he or she wants to send a reaction. Reactions are also only sent to friends and not a random number or stranger. Unlike other apps, where you can receive messages from strangers by accident, Reactr focuses on a user's friends.

""So, whether youâ€™re sending a friend a message showing off an engagement ring after a recent proposal, something hilarious, et cetera, it is now possible to capture your friendâ€™s reaction to that moment and save that keepsake for all of its laughs and awwwâ€™s, for years to come,"" Gilpin told Mashable.

The email thread between several Samsung executives begins on October 4, 2011, the day Apple launched the iPhone 4S. Michael Pennington, then the company's VP of sales for North America, complained that ""it continues to be Samsung's position to avoid attacking Apple directly, due to their status as a large customer"" (of Samsung processors), according to court documents uploaded here by the Wall Street Journal here(Opens in a new window) [PDF].

At most, Pennington wondered if Google might be encouraged to do the attacking in a marketing campaign that Samsung could cooperate on. But three days later, two days after Steve Jobs died, Pennington was singing a different tune. Lamenting that widespread eulogies for Jobs had created an ""unintended benefit for Apple"" because ""what consumer wouldn't feel great about purchasing a device developed by such a person,"" he suggested the time was suddenly right for ads that attacked Apple's products.

""This is our best opportunity to attack iPhone,"" Pennington wrote.

Fortunately, Michael was unharmed and even a little too excited for what just happened.

""Wow, that guy just kicked me in the head -- I think I got that on film,"" exclaimed Michael immediately after the incident.

Maybe the engineer was just trying to save Michael from a much worse fate, or maybe he was trying to teach him a lesson -- or maybe Jimmy Kimmel is the conductor and forgot to pull the brakes on viral hoaxes.

Mashable has reached out to Michael for comment. In the meantime, we'll keep our tin foil hats on.

If he was just trying to take a selfie, as he explains in the video's description, why was he filming a video?

Though we have to give him credit for admitting it was foolish.

""I guess I was still too close and got kicked in the head. I messed up,"" he writes.

Hoax or not, just remember: If you selfie something, make sure you see something first -- like maybe a train coming.

7003845,8 Smartphone Models Will Soon Support Anti-Theft â€˜Kill-Switchâ€™,"Apple, Google, Samsung, HTC, and a handful of the other companies operating in the smartphone industry have entered into a voluntary agreement to add a global anti-theft ""kill-switch"" in their handsets from July 2015.

The news reached us from Re/code(Opens in a new window), which explains in a recently published report that ""devices going on sale after July 2015 will have the ability to remotely wipe data and be rendered inoperable, if the user chooses, to prevent the device from being reactivated without the owners permission."" If a handset is then recovered data can be restored, the publication adds.

Companies on board include Apple, Google, HTC, Huawei, Motorola, Microsoft, Nokia, and Samsung. Carriers have also agreed to ""facilitate these measures,"" Re/code notes.

Crucially, however, this isn't a mandatory kill-switch, and as such not everyone was entirely pleased with the move. The publication cited California state Senator Mark Leno, who criticized the ""opt-in"" nature of the agreement. He said:

The wireless industry today has taken an incremental yet inadequate step to address the epidemic of smartphone theft. Only weeks ago, they claimed that the approach they are taking today was infeasible and counterproductive. While I am encouraged they are moving off of that position so quickly, todays opt-in proposal misses the mark if the ultimate goal is to combat street crime and violent thefts involving smartphones and tablets.

7023741,How Much of Your Taxes Help People in Need?,"Americans scrambled to meet the IRS' deadline on Tuesday to file their tax returns. While the annual process can be tedious and hits many where it really hurts (in the pocketbook), there's a social good silver lining: A chunk of that money went toward helping people in serious need around the world.

ONE(Opens in a new window), the grassroots campaign of more than 3 million people fighting against extreme poverty and preventable diseases, created a web calculator(Opens in a new window) to measure how much impact your taxes have on the good of the planet. Just type in your annual income below, and based on the average tax rate, you can see how much of your money supports foreign aid.

According to the Office of Management and Budget's estimates for the 2014 fiscal year, only 1% of your taxes go toward foreign assistance. The largest chunks are devoted to social security (23.5%) and national defense (17%). They will also support unemployment, Medicare and Medicaid, and interest on the U.S. national debt.

While the percentage that goes to foreign aid is tiny compared to those programs and entitlements, it still accounts for a great deal. The calculator tells you specifically how many vaccines, days of HIV treatment or bed nets you're helping to support.

""There is a common misconception that a large chunk of American tax dollars are spent overseas,"" Tom Hart, ONEâ€™s U.S. executive director, told Mashable. ""When you boil it down, the average American only spends about $84 dollars per year in the fight against extreme poverty. That $84 -- what we might spend on dinner and a movie -- can purchase 211 days of HIV treatment, 48 life-saving vaccines or eight bed nets to protect against malaria.""

7023679,Molecules Can Store Solar Energy Indefinitely,"The next big thing in solar energy could be microscopic.

Scientists at MIT and Harvard University have devised a way to store solar energy in molecules that can then be tapped to heat homes, water or used for cooking.

The best part: The molecules can store the heat forever and be endlessly re-used while emitting absolutely no greenhouse gases. Scientists remain a way's off in building this perpetual heat machine but they have succeeded in the laboratory at demonstrating the viability of the phenomenon called photoswitching.

""Some molecules, known as photoswitches, can assume either of two different shapes, as if they had a hinge in the middle,"" MIT researchers said in statement about the paper published in the journal Nature Chemistry(Opens in a new window). ""Exposing them to sunlight causes them to absorb energy and jump from one configuration to the other, which is then stable for long periods of time.""

To liberate that energy all you have to do is expose the molecules to a small amount of light, heat or electricity and when they switch back to the other shape they emit heat. ""In effect, they behave as rechargeable thermal batteries: taking in energy from the sun, storing it indefinitely, and then releasing it on demand,"" the scientists said.

The researchers used a photoswitching substance called an azobenzene(Opens in a new window), attaching the molecules to substrates of carbon nanotubes. The challenge: Packing the molecules closely enough together to achieve a sufficient energy density to generate usable heat.

It appeared that the researchers had failed when they were only able to pack fewer than half the number of molecules needed as indicated by an earlier computer simulation of the experiment.

But instead of hitting a projected 30% increase in energy density, they saw a 200% increase. It turned out that the key was not so much packing azobenzene molecules tightly on individual carbon nanotubes as packing the nanotubes close together. That's because the azobenzene molecules formed ""teeth"" on the carbon nanotubes, which interlocked with teeth on adjacent nanotubes. The result was the mass needed for a usable amount of energy storage.

That means different combinations of photoswitching molecules and substrates might achieve the same or greater energy storage, according to the researchers.

So how would molecular solar storage work if the technology can be commercialized? Timothy Kucharski, the paper's lead author and a postdoc at MIT and Harvard, told The Atlantic that most likely the storage would take a liquid form, which would be easy to transport.

""It would also enable charging by flowing the material from a storage tank through a window or clear tube exposed to the sun and then to another storage tank, where the material would remain until it's needed,"" Kucharski said in an email. ""That way one could stockpile the charged material for use when the sun's not shining.""

The paper's authors envision the technology could be used in countries where most people rely on burning wood or dung for cooking, which creates dangerous levels of indoor air pollution, leads to deforestation and contributes to climate change.

""For solar cooking, one would leave the device out in the sun during the day,"" says Kucharski. ""One design we have for such an application is purely gravity driven -- the material flows from one tank to another. The flow rate is restricted so that it's exposed to the sun long enough that it gets fully charged. Then, when it's time to cook dinner, after the sun is down, the flow direction is reversed, again driven by gravity, and the opposite side of the setup is used as the cooking surface.""

""As the material flows back to the first tank, it passes by an immobilized catalyst which triggers the energy-releasing process, heating the cooking surface up,"" he adds.

Other versions of such device could be used to heat buildings.",4/16/2014 0:00,0.531207,15,0,11,4.662286,3,Business,3333.76,5582.509,4176.436,24400,0.4676,0.115681,0.047306,0.024967,1,1,2000

Strong currents and bad visibility hindered rescuers in their search for survivors on Thursday, local time, according to the AP.(Opens in a new window) As rescue efforts continue, officials fear the death toll will rise rapidly, as those missing have spent more than 24 hours either trapped in the ferry or in cold water.

More than 400 rescuers searched nearby waters from Wednesday night into Thursday morning, the wire service reported. Twenty divers attempted to enter the ship's wreckage, but were thwarted by the current, the coast guard said, adding that there were 179 survivors as of Thursday morning.

It is still unclear why the ferry sank. Three hours from its destination at the tourist island of Jeju, the ship sent a distress call after it flipped onto its side, South Korea's Ministry of Security and Public Administration said.

Word came down Wednesday that the post-credits â€œstingerâ€ at the end of Amazing Spider-Man 2 featured Mystique, played by Jennifer Lawrence, fighting a group of soldiers alongside some fellow X-Men.

That revelation, by way of the filmâ€™s release overseas, touched off a wave of speculation that Sony, owner of the Spider-Man movie franchise, and 20th Century Fox, which owns X-Men, might be engaged in some kind of major new crossover to mirror the two superheroesâ€™ frequent collaborations in the comic books.

Strike up the sad trombones, nerds: Itâ€™s just a one-off. And the reason for it is pretty standard Hollywood back-scratching.

The three-way split of Marvel properties (Disney owns the big guns with the Avengers and dozens of other characters) continues to be a source of frustration for comic geeks who would love to see more team-ups along the lines of the ones weâ€™ve been reading about (and playing in video games) for decades.

But as long as Disney, Sony and Fox keep making their respective Avengers, Spider-Man and X-Men films, theyâ€™ll retain those rights, keeping a wall of corporate protection between the characters. In other words, thereâ€™s precious little hope that something like Avengers vs. X-Men, Marvelâ€™s 12-issue special event from 2012, would ever be done in movie form.

So why in the world would Sony stick a Fox promo at the end of its major summer tentpole?

Variety reported Wednesday(Opens in a new window) afternoon that it was a simple backroom deal: In order to direct Spider-Man, Marc Webb had to break an existing contract to direct another Fox movie. To make up for it, Sony offered the free promo opportunity.

That's ""bag,"" singular. Bring exactly what you need and not a single item more. Even better, channel Coco Chanel and remove one item from your luggage before you leave the house.

If you're flying, remember to be carry-on friendly: This is a last-minute getaway, and last-minute getaways do not involve spending 45 minutes at baggage claim. You don't want to carry extra weight on your adventure, anyway.

Step 3: Find a Place to Stay

Technology is your best friend when it comes to finding a great place to stay at the last minute. There is no reason in this age of booking apps to drive around a new city looking for a ""Vacancy"" sign.

A hotel must maintain the same price on all of its online listings, whether you find the room on a booking site or on the hotel's own website. There are a couple ways to potentially get around that to find a deal.

Package deals and mobile apps can include rooms priced to sell, according to Gavin at Expedia. On average, travelers save 10% when booking a package compared to what the price would have been when booking each part separately.

Same-day hotel booking app HotelTonight added a new feature Tuesday called ""Look Ahead"" which provides a rate forecast. Previously, the app showed only the prices for a hotel tonight, now provides an informed estimate of what hotel rates will look like in a given city for the next week. ""a snapshot of last-minute room rates and expected savings, hotel availability and other location-specific information for the upcoming week."" The new feature is available in NYC, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Miami, Washington, D.C., Chicago, San Francisco, San Diego and Dallas.

HotelTonight starts listing unsold hotel inventory at 9 a.m. local time each day. Booking on the app takes less than 10 seconds, according to the company, and you can book up to five nights. All the hotels are vetted by HotelTonight staff. The options are ranked based on how good a deal each room is. That means that even if a room isn't the cheapest, it might rank higher because it's a great deal. How much you splurge is up to you.

If renting a house or an apartment is more your style, Airbnb(Opens in a new window) also has listings available same day. Save yourself time communicating with the host by finding a listing with ""Instant book.""

Step 4: See the Sights

You should now have a destination and a place to sleep, but no specific plans for how to spend your time. Lucky for all of us, there are now a growing number of resources and apps that provide recommendations for what to do right now.

7003708,"Twitter Won't Open an Office in Turkey, Refusing Government Demands","Twitter will not open an office in Turkey, rejecting the Turkish government's demands to do so, forcing the company to pay taxes in the country.

A Twitter delegation is currently in Turkey to meet with government officials roughly two weeks after the country lifted the ban on the social network. Colin Crowell, Twitter's vice president and head of global public policy, said the meetings served to explain how Twitter responds to content removal requests and judicial orders and to re-establish ""ties and open relations"" with the government, as reported by The Wall Street Journal(Opens in a new window).

But for now, despite the fact that Turkey's Prime Minister Recep Tayyip ErdoÄŸan accused Twitter of being a ""tax evader(Opens in a new window)"" on Saturday, Twitter won't open a branch in Turkey, which would be the first step to paying taxes in the country.

""We didn't agree to open an office; our decisions to open offices around the world are based upon whether the underlying economic climate justify it,"" Crowell told the WSJ.

In fact, the tax issue didn't even come up in the meetings, according to Crowell.

Late on Monday, local news organization Anadolu Agency reported(Opens in a new window) that Twitter had agreed to act ""more quickly and in a more sensitive manner"" to Turkish courts rulings, and that the company had implemented five court decisions before the meetings ""as a sign of good will.""

Crowell said Twitter is ready to deploy local content bans, and Nu Wexler, a Twitter spokesman, confirmed to Mashable that the company has blocked some accounts, but only within Turkey. Twitter has posted(Opens in a new window) information about the removed content on Chilling Effects(Opens in a new window), a transparency website.

The meetings between Twitter and Turkish government officials are the latest chapter in the conflict between Turkey and U.S. social media companies. It began when ErdoÄŸan blocked Twitter on March 20 and pledged to ""eradicate"" it, amid a series of leaks and documents that allegedly exposed corruption within ErdoÄŸan's government.

Just a week later, the government blocked access to YouTube as well, after an alleged recording of a high-profile government meeting was posted on the video-sharing site.

The ban on Twitter was lifted after a series of legal challenges led the country's Constitutional Court to rule it in violation of Turks' free speech rights. YouTube, despite a recent court ruling ordering the government to unblock it, remains inaccessible.

7003668,The Underwater Drone Helping Search for Flight MH370,"If wreckage from Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 is ever discovered, an underwater drone could very well be the first thing to spot it.

The Bluefin-21 was contracted by the U.S. Navy to dive into the southern Indian Ocean off the west coast of Australia and scan the ocean floor for pieces of the plane that went missing on March 8 with 239 people onboard.

The drone was forced to resurface on April 16 due to a technical issue, according to a press release provided to Mashable by the Joint Agency Coordination Center, a search organization the Australian government created to help find the missing Malaysia airliner. Officials downloaded the drone's memory once it was above water but, so far, Bluefin-21 has turned up nothing significant.

Built by Bluefin Robotics but owned and operated by Phoenix International, this autonomous underwater vehicle takes instructions from a ship's radio before diving up to around 2.8 miles underwater. The remains of flight MH370 might be much farther down, but at that depth Bluefin-21 can blast the ocean floor with a sonar beam.

Data picked up from the sonar will be delivered once the drone resurfaces. Jim Gibson, General Manager of Phoenix International, told Mashable that if Bluefin-21 finds what might be a debris field, someone will switch out the vehicle's sonar instruments with photo-taking equipment and send it back down to see if the clutter comes from the Malaysia Airlines plane. Bluefin-21 scans from side-to-side, and can spend about 16 hours at the bottom before coming up to re-juice.

The ability to swap equipment is key to why this particular drone wound up searching for flight MH370.

â€œItâ€™s easily transported, unlike a lot of the other AUVs that are one piece,"" Gibson said. ""You canâ€™t disassemble them, you need a special launch and recovery system to get them in and out of the water and everything else, and theyâ€™re quite heavy.â€

The '21' refers to the drone's 21-inch diameter(Opens in a new window), according to the Bluefin Robotics website. It's a little over 16 feet long and weighs around 1,650 pounds when it's not in the water. Once it hits its lowest depth, the vehicle travels about three nautical miles per hour and can scan about 15 square miles of ocean floor per day. It stores all that information into its four gigabytes of memory.

Despite this disagreement, both parties said the hours-long meeting was positive.

""The meeting was always held on good terms, with respect and tolerance,"" said Arreaza. ""The peace dialogue is advancing.""

Aveledo, for his part, said the opposition is ""willing, as shown today, to find windows and try to build paths together,"" even though he said the process will be ""complicated.""

The two parties even agreed on three key measures, as reported by the Spanish daily El Pais(Opens in a new window).

First, the opposition formally condemned violence, something that the government had pushed hard for since the student protests that have swept the country have at times turned violent.

Second, the government agreed to add outside figures to the so-called Truth Commission, a group tasked with probing the violent incidents that occurred during the protests. Initially, the commission only included parliament members (five from the government, four from the opposition). Now it will include external experts, who will be nominated in following peace meetings, as reported by the local newspaper El Universal(Opens in a new window).

Finally, the opposition accepted the government's request to join the program ""Safe Homeland(Opens in a new window),"" a government anti-crime plan to boost security on the streets with more police and even military presence. Cities controlled by the opposition were not part of the program until now.

The round of talks on Tuesday was the second formal meeting between the government led by President Nicolas Maduro and an opposition coalition. The groups met for the first time last week on Thursday, in a televised six hours-long event in which Maduro spoke for 45 straight minutes at the beginning.

Not all wings of the opposition are part of the peace talks, however.

Here are six games that have annihilated the Big Apple.

1. Enslaved: Odyssey to the West

Set 150 years into the future, Enslaved: Odyssey to the West is an apocalyptic journey through a destroyed yet ethereally beautiful Earth. Protagonists Trip and Monkey journey to the ruins of New York City, on a mission to get Trip back to her village.

2. Ghostbusters: The Video Game

If there's something strange in your neighborhood, maybe think twice about calling the Ghostbusters.

Based on the comedy of the same name, the game follows three paranormal experts as they run around New York trying to rid the city of ghosts. Sometimes, they do more damage than good, leaving chaos in their wake.

3. Grand Theft Auto IV

Set in the fictional Liberty City, closely modeled after New York, GTA IV is all about wreaking irresponsible havoc, 24/7. Characters run around the city stealing, killing and indulging in their wildest whims. The heart-pumping, open-world game is full of arson attacks, gunfights and car chases.

4. Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty

Originally slated for release in late 2001, stealth action game Metal Gear Solid 2 was bound to virtually annihilate New York City. But when the Sept. 11 terror attacks occurred, the game's developers had to reverse some of MGS' features, including the terrorism-heavy plot and the scenes where half of Manhattan and the Statue of Liberty get brutally crushed. One of the characters, Raiden, even had to have his name changed(Opens in a new window) in the game's Japanese version, because it closely resembled ""Bin Laden.""

But the game still had a little appetite for destruction after that, with characters waging battles all over Manhattan.

5. Rampage: World Tour

Less intense than the other games on this list, Rampage is an arcade-style game where characters run around the world destroying major cities. Naturally, New York is one of them.

Causing the main destruction are three monster characters: a gorilla named George, a Godzilla-like creature named Lizzie and a werewolf named Ralph. Smash your way through major landmarks and skyscrapers with the retro 1997 game.

6. Crysis 3

Like Crysis 2, the third installment in this video game series is set in the city in the semi-distant future of 2047. Swampy and dystopian, New York is transformed into an overgrown, dark wonderland under the rule of a corrupt power.

Main protagonist Prophet sweeps through the streets in the shooter game, seeking to get revenge against CELL, an evil military organization controlling the city.

""Our response has been and remains a categorical refusal -- Russian jurisdiction does not extend to Ukrainian users VKontakte,"" he wrote. ""Giving personal details Ukrainians Russian authorities would not only be against the law, but also a betrayal of all those millions of people in Ukraine who have trusted us.""

Durov, 29, who has been called Russia's Mark Zuckerberg, resigned from his role as Vkontakte CEO on April 1, stating changes in ownership had put pressure(Opens in a new window) on the company's founding ideals, including its support of users' right to freedom of speech -- and those of the protesters in Ukraine.

The Euromaidan protests began in November 2013 after then-President Viktor Yanukovych turned his back on a deal with the EU, choosing instead to align his countryâ€™s future with Moscow. Thousands descended on Kievâ€™s Independence Square, and after weeks of protests, Yanukovych was ousted from office.

In Wednesday's note, Durov says he sold his stake, and he regrets nothing -- because the protection of his users personal data was worth it.

""In the process I had to sacrifice a lot, including my shares in VKontakte,"" he wrote. ""But I do not regret anything -- protection of the personal data of people is worth it and much more.

No, it's not Twitter, but rather Weibo, a Chinese social network whose name literally translates to ""microblog."" In 2009, three years after Twitter launched in the U.S., one of China's largest web portals called Sina launched Weibo to break into China's microblogging space. Weibo quickly signed up tens of millions of users and emerged as the most popular microblogging service in the country.

For those living in China, Weibo serves as a place to engage with brands and celebrities (sound familiar?) and, at least initially, to share pieces of news not censored by the government. In the U.S., however, Weibo rarely makes headlines. That may change soon.

Weibo filed to go public in the U.S. last month and is expected to begin trading on the Nasdaq on Thursday under the ticker ""WB."" The company has said it will price its shares between $17-$19, potentially raising as much as $380 million from the public offering with a valuation just shy of $4 billion. That would make Weibo one of the larger tech IPOs of the year to date, but it is a far cry Twitter's.

The little bird has a much bigger valuation

Twitter raised $1.82 billion from its IPO, valuing it at just more than $14 billion. Twitter's stock shot up by more than 70% on its first day of trading, giving the social network a hefty market cap of around $25 billion.

Weibo had reportedly(Opens in a new window) been looking for a valuation in the $7 billion-$8 billion range, but fell short in part because the market is a little less frothy now than it was six months ago when Twitter went public.

Weibo's user base vs. Twitter's user base

As with Twitter, there are also concerns that Weibo may struggle to keep up user growth. Weibo had 143.8 million monthly active users in the March quarter and 66.6 million daily active users, compared to 107.3 million and 48.6 million, respectively, a year earlier.

""We anticipate that our user growth rate will slow over time as the size of our user base increases,"" according to Weibo's filing(Opens in a new window) with the SEC. ""To the extent our user growth rate slows, our success will become increasingly dependent on our ability to increase user engagement.""

Twitter had 241 million monthly active users in the December quarter and 100 million daily active users as of October.

Not as strong with mobile or monetization (yet)

One of Twitter's strengths has been that it was built for mobile first, unlike Facebook, and was therefore well-positioned for the mobile era. For Weibo, on the other hand, mobile is a bit more of a concern.

Yue Yao, an analyst with Morningstar, wrote in a recent report that Weibo is struggling to compete with WeChat, a popular mobile messaging app in China, in the mobile space. ""As user engagement of social networking services in China rapidly shifts to mobile devices from PCs, we have continuously witnessed the usage of Sina Weibo on mobile devices being constrained by Tencentâ€™s WeChat,"" Yao wrote. ""We have also identified a weaker monetization engine for Weiboâ€™s business at the mobile end due to the limited display ad space on mobile devices.""

Weibo began monetizing in 2012 with ""social display ads"" and generated revenue of just more than $188 million in 2013, with a net loss of $38.1 million. Twitter generated $665 million in revenue last year, though it also posted significantly higher losses for the year.

The more telling stat may be the revenue per user: Bloomberg(Opens in a new window) calculates that Weibo pulled in $1.46 per user as of the end of 2013 while Twitter pulled in $2.76.

The caged bird may not sing

Perhaps the most striking different between Twitter and Weibo -- and also one of Weibo's chief business risks -- is censorship.

Twitter has a reputation for pushing back against governments and fighting for greater transparency. But Weibo operates in a country with a government that can crack down on Internet companies for showing content that, in Weibo's words, ""impairs the national dignity of China, is reactionary, obscene, superstitious, fraudulent or defamatory..."" Many users have reportedly(Opens in a new window) already shifted away from the service as it has cracked down on free speech.

If Weibo doesn't comply with the government, it could be held liable for the information that is shared and risks having some of its licenses to operate revoked. If Weibo does comply with the government, it risks losing its users. Weibo lays out the latter concern best in the Risk Factors section of its IPO filing.",4/16/2014 0:00,0.636086,2,0,1,4.918675,8,Tech,0,3615.506,2718.448,2000,0.441369,-0.00164,0.03012,0.039157,0.783333,0.466667,1600

CEO Marissa Mayer wants to supplant Google as Apple's default search on mobile products, according to a report from Re/code(Opens in a new window).

[seealso slug=http://mashable.com/2014/02/12/yahoo-contextual-search/]

If successful, the arrangement would prove a coup for Yahoo and drastically change the company's share of the search market(Opens in a new window), particularly in the rapidly growing mobile segment.

Mobile search is not only growing, it is moving away from desktop(Opens in a new window). If Yahoo were able to convince Apple to use its mobile search, it would grow its declining search share to the detriment of desktop competitors.

Mobile search is a particularly important area for Yahoo, as its desktop search is handcuffed by a deal with Microsoft that predates Mayer's time at the company. Yahoo's desktop search is powered by Microsoft's Bing, a deal that provides Yahoo with revenue but has reportedly been disappointing to Mayer(Opens in a new window). The deal is scheduled to run through 2019.

The report lines up with numerous recent moves by Yahoo to bolster its mobile and contextual search technology, as well as public comments from Mayer.

A recent partnership with Yelp provides a wealth of local business data that tends to be popular for people searching on mobile devices. Yahoo also has taken steps to develop Siri-like software that will also factor in various clues like a person's location or time of day to generate better search results.

7003685,Zuckerberg on Mobile Apps: 'Facebook is Not One Thing',"Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the company's latest mission is to ""unbundle the big blue app"" and provide disparate experiences on mobile with or without the Facebook name.

""Facebook is not one thing, he told The New York Times(Opens in a new window). ""On desktop where we grew up, the mode that made the most sense was to have a website, and to have different ways of sharing built as features within a website. So when we ported to mobile, thatâ€™s where we started â€” this one big blue app that approximated the desktop presence.""

[seealso slug=""facebook-future""]

Chief among Facebook's efforts to diversify its mobile portfolio is the $19 billion bid to purchase WhatsApp. Zuckerberg justified the expense by noting that the messaging space is bigger than the company realized and that consumers use it differently than Facebook's Messenger.

""Messenger is more about chatting with friends and WhatsApp is like an SMS replacement,"" he told The New York Times. ""Those things sound similar, but when you go into the nuances of how people use it, they are both very big in different markets.""

Zuckerberg said that Messenger is a ""really successful thing"" and that more than 10 billion messages a day flow through Facebook's messaging products. Facebook recently unbundled messaging functionality from Facebook's mobile app to encourage users to download the Messenger app instead. The company claims Messenger provides a better user experience.

The mobile initiatives are put under the auspices of Creative Labs, which the company has described as a ""mindset"" within the company rather than a group or department. Facebook announced Creative Labs in January when it introduced its Paper news reader app.

Zuckerberg didn't discuss how Paper is doing. Less than a month after launch, though, the app fell out of the top 100 free apps in Apple's App Store. He said however that Home, the company's mobile-based immersive experience introduced last April, was ""much slower than we expected.""

He added that assessing the success of Home, Messenger or other apps was premature:

The other thing that is important context to keep in mind is that, to some extent, most of these new things that weâ€™re doing arenâ€™t going to move any needles in our business for a very long time. The main Facebook usage is so big. About 20% of the time people spend on their phone is on Facebook.

7003548,Micro Magnet Robots Can Build Mini Super Structures,"Magnets and their properties have long fascinated everyone from children to scientists, but it's unlikely youâ€™ve ever seen them harnessed quite like this.

SRI International(Opens in a new window), a non-profit research firm serving government and industry, has found a novel way to control tiny, low cost magnets via electromagnetic pulses delivered to them through contact with printed circuit boards.

[seealso slug=""15-nerd-tastic-robots-ces-2014""]

The patented process, known as Diamagnetic Micro Manipulation (DM3), can move magnetically actuated micro-robots at speeds of up to 3 CM per second, in any direction and even along curved circuit boards. As long as thereâ€™s an electromagnetic current running through the circuitry, the magnets will hold on and do your bidding. The system can host not just one magnet on a board, but dozens, which can work together or perform separate task. All the instruction comes through the electromagnetic pulses in the board.

Making one or even dozens of little magnets move and almost dance in unison is entertaining, but it's when SRI started adding what it calls ""effectors"" to the magnets that things got really interesting. ""Effectors"" are basically little pieces of wires or other add-ons that allow the magnets to pick up, hold and manipulate materials.

In the video above, the magnets are programmed to grab, move and glue carbon-fiber sticks. Eventually, they built a 29-centimeter-long truss capable of supporting up to 2 kg.

According to SRI, which is working on the project with DARPA, ""Our vision is to enable an assembly head containing thousands of micro-robots to manufacture high-quality macro-scale products while providing millimeter-scale structural control.""

The company believes these micro robots could someday power entire micro factories.

The video, by the way, looks pretty mundane until you realize itâ€™s garden variety magnets acting as if theyâ€™re alive and capable of working as hard as youâ€™re everyday construction worker.",4/17/2014 0:00,0.588785,1,2,0,4.516055,6,Entertainment,1872.667,5689.75,3973.167,9300,0.457804,0.126951,0.036697,0.016055,0.275,0.016667,830

6866811,Research Finds Arsenic Poisoning in Chilean Mummies,"People of numerous pre-Columbian civilizations in northern Chile, including the Incas and the Chinchorro culture, suffered from chronic arsenic poisoning due to their consumption of contaminated water, new research suggests.

Previous analyses showed high concentrations of arsenic(Opens in a new window) in the hair samples of mummies from both highland and coastal cultures in the region. However, researchers weren't able to determine whether the people had ingested arsenic(Opens in a new window) or if the toxic element in the soil had diffused into the mummies' hair after they were buried.

In the new study, scientists used a range of high-tech methods to analyze hair samples from a 1,000- to 1,500-year-old mummy from the TarapacÃ¡ Valley in Chile's Atacama Desert. They determined the high concentration of arsenic in the mummy's hair came from drinking arsenic-laced water and, possibly, eating plants irrigated with the toxic water.

""In Chile, you have these sediments that are rich in arsenic because of copper-mining activities in the highlands,"" which expose arsenic and other pollutants, said lead study author Ioanna Kakoulli, an archaeological scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles. ""When it rains, the arsenic can leach out into the rivers.""

Analyzing hair

In fields ranging from forensics to archaeology, hair is widely used to gain insight into the lives of modern and past peoples. Unlike other biological samples, such as bone and skin tissue that change over time, hair remains stable after it forms (keratinizes). This feature, along with hair's steady growth rate(Opens in a new window), means that it can provide a chronological record of the substances that previously circulated in the blood.

In the past, scientists have analyzed the hair samples of the mummies from the pre-Columbian populations that lived in Chile's Atacama Desert between A.D.?500 and 1450. The remains showed patterns of chronic poisoning, which some researchers have suspected was due to these populations' consumption of water contaminated with arsenic. But the methods didn't allow them to determine how the arsenic got into the mummies' hair.

""They didn't map where the arsenic is precipitated on the hair â€” they just took it and dissolved it,"" Kakoulli told Live Science. With this technique, you cannot tell if the arsenic wound up in the hair externally, or if it was ingested and traveled through the bloodstream first, she said.

To learn more about the possible arsenic poisoning of the ancient people from northern Chile, Kakoulli and her colleagues looked at a naturally preserved mummy(Opens in a new window) that was buried in the TR40-A cemetery in the TarapacÃ¡ Valley of the Atacama Desert. Using portable techniques that were noninvasive and nondestructive, they imaged and analyzed the mummy's skin, clothes and hair, as well as the soil encrusting the mummy.

As expected, the team detected arsenic in the mummy's hair and in the soil. They also discovered skin conditions indicative of arsenic poisoning(Opens in a new window). Though these findings were suggestive of arsenic ingestion, they weren't definitive, so the researchers collected hair samples to analyze further in the lab.

Finding the source

Kakoulli and her colleagues imaged the hair samples with a very-high-resolution scanning electron microscope. They also subjected the samples to various tests with the synchrotron light source â€” a large particle accelerator that analyzes materials with intense, focused X-ray beams â€” at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California, allowing them to map the distribution of the elements and minerals in the hair.

Their tests revealed a uniform, radial distribution of arsenic in the hair. If the hair had been contaminated from arsenic in the soil, the toxic element would have only coated the surface, Kakoulli said. Comparisons of the arsenic in the soil and hair also showed the soil contained much lower concentrations of the element.

Furthermore, the dominant form of arsenic in the hair was a type called arsenic III, while the inorganic arsenic in surface water and groundwater(Opens in a new window) is mostly arsenic V. Studies have suggested that the body ""biotransforms"" ingested arsenic into arsenic III.

""The results are consistent with modern epidemiological studies of arsenic poisoning by ingestion,"" Kakoulli said, adding that the technological approach used in the study could prove useful to forensic investigations and toxicity assessments in archaeology.

The team is now using the same approach to see if the ancient people of the TarapacÃ¡ Valley used certain hallucinogens, as some individuals were buried with exotic Amazonian seeds and various hallucinogenic paraphernalia. If the people buried with the items didn't use the hallucinogens, it would suggest they were shaman or doctors who used the hallucinogenic plants to aid other people, the researchers said.

""It then becomes a question about the level of interaction they had with the people of the Amazon, because the seeds aren't from Chile,"" Kakoulli said. ""They would've had to have known the properties of the seeds and where to get them.""",4/17/2014 0:00,0.435807,6,21,0,5.002225,9,00000,0,5773.475,2475.168,5400,0.361811,0.117185,0.031146,0.013348,0.75,0.8,1300
5209413,Giant Asteroid Set Earth's Crust in Motion 3 Billion Years Ago,"Earth was still a violent place shortly after life began, with regular impactors arriving from space. For the first time, scientists have modeled the effects of one such violent event - the strike of a giant asteroid. The effects were so catastrophic that, along with the large earthquakes and tsunamis it created, this asteroid may have also set continents into motion.

The asteroid to blame for this event would have been at least 37km in diameter, which is roughly four times the size of the asteroid that is alleged to have caused the death of dinosaurs. It would have hit the surface of the Earth at the speed of about 72,000kph and created a 500km-wide crater.

At the time of the event, about 3.26 billion years ago, such an impact would have caused 10.8 magnitude earthquakes - roughly 100 times the size of the 2011 Japanese earthquake, which is among the biggest in recent history. The impact would have thrown vaporized rock into the atmosphere, which would have encircled the globe before condensing and falling back to the surface. During the debris re-entry, the temperature of the atmosphere would have increased and the heat wave would have caused the upper oceans to boil.

Donald Lowe and Norman Sleep at Stanford University, who published their research in the journal Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems, were able to say all this based on tiny, spherical rocks found in the Barberton greenstone belt in South Africa. These rocks are the only remnants of the cataclysmic event.

According to Simon Redfern at the University of Cambridge, there are two reasons why Lowe and Sleep were able to do find these rocks. First, the Barberton greenstone belt is located on a craton, which is the oldest and most stable part of the crust. Second, at the time of the event, this area was at the bottom of the ocean with ongoing volcanic activity. The tiny rocks, after having been thrown into the atmosphere, cooling, and falling to the bottom of the ocean, then ended up trapped in the fractures created by volcanic activity.

Credit: AGU

This impact may have been among the last few major impacts from the Late Heavy Bombardment period between 3 and 4 billion years ago. The evidence of most of these impacts has been lost because of erosion and the movement of the Earth's crust, which recycles the surface over geological time.

However, despite providing such rich details about the impact, Lowe and Sleep are not able to pinpoint the location of the impact. It would be within thousands of kilometres of the Barberton greenstone system, but that is about all they can say. The exact location may not be that important, Lowe argued: ""With this study, we are trying to understand the forces that shaped our planet early in its evolution and the environments in which life evolved.""

One of the most intriguing suggestions the authors make is that this three-billion-year-old impact may have initiated the the movement of tectonic plates, which created the continents that we observe on the planet.

The continents ride on plates that make up Earth's thin crust; the crust sits on top of the mantle, which is above a core of liquid iron and nickel. The heat trapped in the mantle creates convection, which pushes against the overlying plates(Opens in a new window).

All the rocky planets in our solar system - Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars - have the same internal structure. But only Earth's crust shows signs of plate motion.

A possible reason why Earth has moving plates may be to do with the heat trapped in the mantle. Other planets may not have as much heat trapped when they formed, which means the convection may not be strong enough to move the plates.

However, according to Redfern: ""Even with a hot mantle you would need something to destabilise the crust."" And it is possible that an asteroid impact of this magnitude could have achieved that.",4/17/2014 0:00,0.398872,39,11,0,4.719021,10,00000,0,4215.784,2852.911,2400,0.382016,0.178356,0.051302,0.014996,0,0,1200

7003440,"The Insane, Probably Fake, Plan to Brighten the Moon","It sounds like the plot of a James Bond movie: There's a plan afoot to make the moon brighter in the night sky, potentially saving the world billions of dollars in power costs running street lamps.

How would such an ambitious idea even be possible? By strategically placing highly reflective material on the lunar surface. A lot of it.

[seealso slug=""new-york-city-planets""]

The project is called Brighter Moon(Opens in a new window), and Swedish parent company Foreo says it has already secured more than $52 million in funding.

The thing is, Foreo is a cosmetics company. When asked for more information on the backers of Brighter Moon, company reps declined to name even one, citing privacy reasons. The ""Foreo Institute""(Opens in a new window) is also supposedly trying to crowd-fund a new kind of toothbrush(Opens in a new window) -- which may in fact be real -- so the moon project may be an elaborate hoax created to drum up interest in that.

Still, Brighter Moon proposes an interesting, if fanciful scenario. It also makes some good points: The moon reflects only about 12% of the sunlight that impacts it. By using the right material in the right places -- over an area the size of Switzerland, or about 0.1% of the lunar surface -- the amount of reflected light could be increased by 80%.

Foreo has an ambitious plan to make the surface of the moon more reflective, brightening it in the night sky. Credit: Foreo

The effect wouldn't exactly turn night into day, more like night into twilight. And since the same side of the moon always faces to Earth, so would the reflective material.

The moon's light waxes and wanes -- and is only full for three days a month -- so the amount of extra brightness would vary, reducing to nothing when there's a new moon. Thus, the true night sky, which has been a fundamental part of human society since the dawn of civilization, would be preserved. It just would happen less often.

The benefits to a brighter moon could be massive: Keeping street lights on all night consumes a lot of power, which in turn adds to greenhouse-gas emissions. That's exactly why many cities, including New York(Opens in a new window), are switching to more efficient LED lighting.

While a brighter moon wouldn't make street lights obsolete, their use could be reduced considerably, leading to global-scale power savings and reductions in greenhouse gases. Not to mention the safety benefits.

Of course, there would be trade-offs. A brighter moon means no visible stars for several nights a month, which would have a severe impact on astronomy, which already suffers greatly from ""light pollution."" Humans and other animals may find their sleep and nocturnal activities disrupted. And there's the question of how messing with something as basic as night would affect our collective human psyche.

Foreo says it has considered the major issues, and that a planned 30-year rollout of the project would mitigate many of the problems. But it's probably just a joke anyway (although the company insists it's not), so it's not like it matters.

Like space elevators, Mars colonies and Dyson spheres(Opens in a new window), the Brighter Moon project will likely never become a reality -- at least not for a long, long time.

7023197,California Suffers Astonishingly Fast Snowpack Melt as Drought Intensifies,"The severe drought that threatens water supplies and a potentially devastating wildfire season is deepening and locking into place across much of the far West, Southwest and Southern Plains, according to new climate data released Thursday.

In California's Sierra Nevada Mountains, where runoff from the spring snowpack provides much-needed water supplies during the dry season, half of the snowpack's liquid water equivalent(Opens in a new window) melted in just the past week in some areas, due to temperatures that soared as high as 12 degrees Fahrenheit above average of early April, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor.

To make matters worse, the sudden snow melt in California barely boosted reservoir supplies, which remain well below average across the state.

Officials already knew that the snowpack was unusually thin and would provide below average amounts of water when it melted, considering that the state had its third-driest winter on record, following its driest calendar year in 2013. However, they did not anticipate it would melt so quickly.

The California state snow survey on April 1 found that the snowpack contained just 32% of the average water content at that time of year, when snowpack typically reaches its annual peak. This placed 2014 as among the lowest water-content years on record since such data began in 1930.

The California drought is part of a broader regional drought that encompasses parts of Oregon, Nevada, Colorado, Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas and Oklahoma, among other areas. In a conference call with reporters on Thursday, scientists from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) said the California drought is likely to persist(Opens in a new window) throughout the summer, after average precipitation fell during March. This precipitation failed to make up for the deep precipitation deficits the state had been running.

Southern Plains Drought

According to NOAA, drought has expanded and intensified in the Southern Plains as well, where parts of Oklahoma and Texas have been stuck in devastatingly arid conditions since 2010. The geographic extent of extreme and exceptional drought has increased nearly four-fold in Texas, more than five-fold in Oklahoma, and nearly six-fold in New Mexico since the beginning of winter, according to David Brown, a NOAA climate specialist.

New Mexico has had its third-driest start to the year, and Oklahoma and Texas have each had their sixth-driest starts to the year, Brown says.

Nearly two million Southern Plains residents are currently living in areas with ""extreme"" or ""exceptional"" drought conditions, which are the two worst categories on the Drought Monitor's scale. The number of affected residents more than doubled since the start of winter, according to Brown. Most of these people are in west Texas and the Texas panhandle, including the cities of Lubbock, Amarillo and Wichita Falls.

In Wichita Falls, city officials are preparing to raise their water restrictions to an unprecedented ""Stage 5"" emergency, which would trigger dramatic restrictions on water use. The city also plans to spend $300,000 on cloud seeding this spring(Opens in a new window), to try to increase rainfall production from thunderstorms. Cloud seeding, which can increase rainfall slightly under specific circumstances, has no chance of alleviating the drought itself, but it could provide some short-term benefits.

Since the start of the drought in October 2010, Wichita Falls has had about 58 inches of rain (and melted snow and ice), Brown said. The typical amount for that period of time is 100 inches. This means that the city needs to make up about a year and a half's worth of precipitation. Alleviating the drought this spring and summer, Brown says, ""would really take an unprecedented amount of spring rainfall.â€

Victor Murphy, a NOAA meteorologist, gave Mashable further details on Wichita Falls' plight. He said data shows that the past 42 months have been the driest such consecutive period on record in that city, eclipsing any of the drought years in the 1950s and the 1930s ""Dust Bowl"" era. For water planning purposes, the early 1950s drought is considered to be the drought of record, meaning that the current drought is worse than what policymakers may have prepared for.

The drought is raising concerns about wildfires and massive dust storms this summer, and has already caused an agricultural disaster in the Southern Plains. Texas cattle herds have thinned out, as ranchers are forced to send them to meat plants earlier than planned, or move them northward to states that have water. In response to the drought conditions from Oklahoma to California, meat prices have spiked to their highest level since 1987, and egg prices have also risen by nearly 10% compared to last year, according to the March Consumer Price Index report(Opens in a new window). Avocado prices(Opens in a new window) are also going up in response to the California drought.

Although May and June are Texas and Oklahoma's wettest months on average, there is such a big rainfall deficit in parts of these states that the drought will almost certainly not be fully eliminated.

If an El NiÃ±o event develops as expected by the fall, it could lead to unusually wet conditions from California to Texas next winter, but that is neither guaranteed to happen, nor would it be of any help in the short-term.",4/17/2014 0:00,0.455285,3,10,0,4.707661,8,Tech,1864.625,4123.765,3100.275,2700,0.468516,0.117123,0.038306,0.018145,0.5,0.5,1200
7023351,"Cannes: 15 Women Directors, Tame Dragons and Ryan Gosling's First Time","The abysmal state of affairs for female directors in Hollywood got a tiny glimmer of hope in Paris this week, as the Cannes Film Festival announced its lineup: a group including 15 female filmmakers (though only two are in the main competition this year).

Another quirky highlight from the 2014 fest is the world premiere of Lost River, the directorial debut of Ryan Gosling, who also wrote the bizarre tale of a single mom swept into a dark and twisted underworld (kind of like in Drive). Ben Mendelssohn (The Dark Knight Rises), Saoirse Ronan (The Host) and Gosling's main-squeeze-for-now Eva Mendes (and his co-star in The Place Beyond the Pines) also star in the film.

Starting with Shrek in 2001, DreamWorks Animation has been a stalwart at Cannes many times over, and is reprising that role this year with How to Train Your Dragon 2, which is making its world premiere out of competition. Organizers said thereâ€™s one more out-of-competition film yet to be announced; look for that to be a big Hollywood film as well.

Eighteen movies will fight for the Palme d'Or, the highest prize awarded at Cannes, in the competition lineup, including Tommy Lee Jonesâ€™ The Homesman, starring Meryl Streep and Hilary Swank -- just Jonesâ€™ second feature film as director and his first in nine years. Moneyball director Bennett Millerâ€™s Foxcatcher, starring Channing Tatum, is also in competition, alongside David Cronenbergâ€™s Maps to the Stars with Robert Pattinson and Julianne Moore.

And we already knew that Cannes would open with Grace of Monaco starring Nicole Kidman as the princess.

As for those women directors, well -- it's not exactly jump-up-and-down good news, but let's call it progress.

The two female-directed films in competition -- Alice Rohrwacher's (above, left) Le Meraviglie and Naomi Kawase's (above, right) Still the Water -- actually doubles the number in the past two years, which featured one apiece (in 2012, there were none). The 15 female-led films overall is more promising; last year, there were only six.

The only woman to win the Palme d'Or was Jane Campion, for The Piano in 1993; she's presiding over the jury this year. At a time when study after study shows that women aren't getting anything near a fair shake behind the camera, it's all welcome news.

Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warns that a changing climate will cause an array of new environmental problems -- and there's no better day to respond than on Earth Day.

Over a billion people in 190 countries celebrate Earth Day each year with a variety of outdoor activities or action events, according to the Earth Day Network(Opens in a new window). The annual event, which began in 1970 and is celebrated on April 22, this year's global focus is on green cities and the need to make cities more environmentally resilient and communities more sustainable.

Every year, festivals, galas and activities are planned by the Earth Day Network and other organizations, and many places like some college campuses(Opens in a new window) are pledging to extend Earth Day into an Earth Week. Whether you live in a city, a suburb or a rural area, our list of ways to participate, below, is all about making Earth Day more relevant than ever before.

NASAâ€™s Global Selfie

In honor of NASAâ€™s five Earth-observing missions that will launch into space in one year â€“â€“ the first in a decade â€“â€“ it is asking(Opens in a new window) people to join in and take a â€œselfieâ€ somewhere in Earth's outdoors and share it on social media with the hashtag #GlobalSelfie.

The Global Selfie is â€œdesigned to encourage environmental awareness and recognize [NASA]â€™s ongoing work to protect our home planet,"" NASA said in a press release(Opens in a new window).

While other organizations are calling for selfies as part of their Earth Day celebrations (see below), NASA plans on using all of the selfies to create a new image of the iconic â€œBlue Marbleâ€ Earth photo â€“â€“ a mosaic made up of people's faces and outdoor places.

National Park Week

The U.S. National Park Service and the National Park Foundation are hosting National Park Week(Opens in a new window) from April 19 to April 27, with two free entrance days on April 19 and April 20 at all of the nation's national parks, including Yosemite and the Grand Canyon.

The National Park Service is encouraging people to participate in Earth Day by either visiting and taking a walk in a park(Opens in a new window) or joining(Opens in a new window) a volunteer group activity.

Get Out Photo Contest

NASA isnâ€™t the only one using photo contests to get people outside. As part of its 2014 Get Out photo contest(Opens in a new window), The Sierra Club wants people to photograph and submit their favorite way to get outside. Anyone who participates is entered to win an eight-day backpacking trip in Grand Canyon Park.

The Sierra Club is encouraging people to Get Out either on their own or by joining an ""explore, enjoy or protect"" activity in their local community.

Nature Selfies

Selfie, the word of the year in 2013, is still this yearâ€™s buzzword and the theme for several Earth Day campaigns, in addition to NASA's, like ICF International's..

ICF International, a consulting firm based in Virginia, is asking people(Opens in a new window) to take a selfie while enjoying the outdoors, tag it with #SelfiesInNature and share it on Twitter, Instagram or Facebook. For every photo shared, the company will plant a tree via the Arbor Day Foundation.

The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and The Nature Conservancy are also asking(Opens in a new window) people to do the same, but with the hashtag #NatureSelfie. Though thereâ€™s no prize but enjoying nature, the EPAâ€™s website states(Opens in a new window) that it hopes to make this project continue in the future, â€œwhere participants can return to the same tree, flower or blooming plant a year later and take another photo of it. Changes in blooming patterns could be examined and may have a connection to climate change.â€

Community Cleanups

The World Wildlife Fund (WWF) is inviting(Opens in a new window) people to celebrate the Earth by hosting a cleanup in their communities. Supporters can start a campaign to either participate in a cleanup or commit to recycling and reducing their carbon footprints, by using Panda Nation, the company's fundraising platform. Any team that raises $150 or more will receive a free water bottle and tote bag.

Thunderclap Campaigns

While everyone should get outside on Earth Day, organizations are also taking to social media to raise awareness of environmental issues. Using Thunderclap, a social media tool that sends out timed messages based on how many people support the campaign, organizations are hoping to spark a wave of action and attention on Twitter, Facebook and Tumblr.

The EPA has a campaign(Opens in a new window) encouraging people to commit to protect the climate. Climate Reality's campaign(Opens in a new window) asks people to support their call of action to cut carbon pollution from power plants and there are more campaigns(Opens in a new window) on the website.

Anyone can participate in the efforts, as long they have a Twitter, Facebook or Tumblr. Participants click on which social media platform they'd like to Thunderclap on, customize the message, and their support is added â€“â€“ all in minutes.

If none of these activities scream Earth Day to you, there are more ways to participate locally and remotely, like sending a letter to local and state governments about a bike share program or attending a local Earth Day festival. These and more can be found by visiting the Earth Day Network's website(Opens in a new window).

After all, the drive-through lane can be pretty tempting after a long day in the office, and who hasn't stayed up an extra hour and a half half-hour watching just one more episode of the latest Netflix phenomenon?

But the truth is that sensible choices can help with your energy level. Tweaking small daily choices -- like adding in a few glasses of water to your afternoon routine, choosing healthy snacks or going to bed earlier to avoid hitting the snooze button seven times in the morning -- can make a difference in your overall well-being and happiness. And with an extra bounce in your step, who knows what more you can accomplish during your typical day-to-day?

[seealso slug=""human-energy-brandspeak""]

Developing a sensible routine is the best way to optimize your energy levels and attain a positive energy loop that could provide you with the willpower to make the most out of your day. Creating those good habits doesn't have to be difficult.

Timing is key when it comes to meals, sleep and exercise. Want to avoid a mid-morning slump sans coffee? Easy -- be sure to eat breakfast and keep a wholesome snack on hand for a mid-morning refuel. Always thought it'd be nice to be a morning person? Amp up your a.m. energy by turning off devices an hour before bed.

These changes may seem small, but your body works on an internal clock -- and using that clock to your advantage will give you the energy to tackle creative or concentration-heavy tasks in your day-to-day routine. Take a look at the infographic below for more tips and tricks to optimize your energy via sensible habits.

4506306,Eyefi Launches Wi-Fi Memory Cards Into the Cloud,"Youâ€™d think most new digital cameras would come with built-in Wi-Fi these days, but only 46% of those that ship in 2014 will have the ability to connect to the Internet.

And sure, there's no denying you can take better quality photos on digital cameras -- compared to whatâ€™s typically found on a smartphone -- but thereâ€™s something to say for the convenience of sharing photos directly from a mobile device.

[seealso slug=""bad-tech-care""]

Eyefi, the maker of Wi-Fi SD memory cards (and used to be named ""Eye-Fi""), has long turned digital cameras into wireless hotspots, but itâ€™s now offering a full cloud-based storage service called Eyefi Cloud. This means youâ€™ll be able to snap photos on a digital camera and instantaneously access them across all platforms -- not just your smartphone and tablets, but the web, too. And your pics will stay there.

Credit: Eyefi

Previously, Eye-Fi users could transfer through the cloud, but the service more like a relay to send the photos to a photo service or computer. Last year, Eyefi added instant image transfer from its cards to mobile devices with the launch of its Mobi wireless SD memory card.

The price of the Eyefi Mobi SD card stays the same ($49 for 8B), but it now comes with three months of the cloud service for free. Twelve-month memberships start at $49 for an unlimited number of photos.

With the membership, after setup and as soon as you take some photos with a digital camera equipped with Eyefi, they'll appear across various services and devices. You can manage the photos and albums either via an accompanying app or through the website.

Setup is easy and relatively intuitive. Eyefi works with all the major DSL camera manufacturers -- Canon, Nikon, Casio and so on, which install the firmware into their products -- so the connected SD cards work directly with them when inserted. On some models, a flashing Wi-Fi symbol signals that the camera is reading the card.

You'll then want to download the Eyefi app, register for an account and then sync the devices you want to the service. You can then go in and share photos and albums with others, as well as make labels and sort by date. A handy feature in the ""share"" section lets you keep track of who's viewed the pictures, if -- for example -- you were to post a link to your Facebook profile page.

Existing Mobi SD card users can also get a free trial membership too (and the previous card model is the same as the new one, with a bit of new packaging and design colors).",4/17/2014 0:00,0.55814,8,1,0,4.520737,7,Tech,0,3831.649,2364.422,5550,0.395588,0.1,0.02765,0.041475,0.2,-0.1,3400
7003276,Facebook Launches 'Nearby Friends' Location Feature for Meet-Ups IRL,"Facebook has always encouraged you to share with your friends -- your favorite movies, pictures, and life updates. Now Facebook wants you sharing your location, too.

The social network on Thursday announced Nearby Friends, a new feature built into Facebook's mobile app that allows you to see which of your friends are close by, and even share your exact location with others.

[seealso slug=""news-feed-changes""]

The new feature uses the geolocation technology in your smart phone to determine when you are close to one of your Facebook friends. When activated, the feature will send periodic notifications alerting you to friends who are nearby. Users have been able to check in on Facebook for some time, meaning you can already share your location as part of a post, but Nearby Friends allows you to broadcast your general location to Facebook friends without posting at all.

The new feature is opt-in, meaning you'll need to activate it within the app, should you choose to participate. Users who do not activate Nearby Friends won't be affected in any way, and will not share with or receive any location information from others on the platform.

â€œThe mission of Facebook is to connect people, to bring people together,"" says Andrea Vaccari, the product manager for the new feature. ""Nearby Friends sort of pushes that forward by making it a little easier to find new opportunities to meet your friends while youâ€™re out and about.â€

How to use Nearby Friends

To see friends in your area, turn on Nearby Friends in settings within the mobile app. This feature is opt-in, meaning you must manually activate it if you want to be seen (or see others). Once the feature is activated, you'll go through a small tutorial that explains how to use the feature.

You can select the groups on Facebook with which you want to share your location. You can't share your location with the public or with friends of friends. You can only share it with friends or other groups that you have created, like ""close friends"" or ""family.""

Facebook will notify you when friends are nearby, at which point you can message those friends if you want to connect. You won't be able to see a friend's exact location, however. For example, the app may say that a friend is within two miles, but the exact coordinates will not be shared automatically.

The app won't specify a distance closer than 0.5 miles, but Nearby Friends can discover people that are much further away -- even on a separate coast. One Facebook employee used the feature to track another employee's travels through Europe.

You can show your exact location to a friend, if you so choose, by sharing your location on a map for a set amount of time (until 6 p.m., for example) or by sharing your location indefinitely. When you choose this option, the friend you share with will have access to your exact location in real-time. Sharing your specific location may make sense if you are trying to help someone find you for lunch or drinks. Otherwise, simply being alerted that a friend is in the area may be enough.

If you turn on Nearby Friends, it will not turn off automatically. You will continue to broadcast your approximate location until the feature is manually turned off. Users be reminded that they are sharing their location thanks to push notifications, says Vaccari.

The new feature is intended to help friends meet offline, says Vaccari, whose startup Glancee was acquired by Facebook back in 2012. Vaccari, who grew up in Italy, was building similar technology at Glancee in order to meet new people, a challenge he faced when he came to the United States. At Facebook, the technology only applies to a user's friends, which Vaccari believes will encourage more people to try it out.

Facebook has been testing the feature with the ""vast majority"" of the company's 6,500-plus employees for close to 18 months, according to Vaccari. During that time, Facebook used employee feedback to shape the feature and hone the notification algorithm. At the beginning, users received notifications that they had friends nearby all the time, says Vaccari.

Those notifications were scaled back as the product evolved. Alerting you that a friend is nearby every time you walk into the office or get home to your roommate defeated the purpose, the team decided.

Like many of Facebook's technologies, the feature adapts as it learns more about you. â€œThe app learns where you spend most of your time, and it avoids sending notifications when youâ€™re at those locations,"" explains Vaccari. Facebook collects this data and stores it on company servers, but Vaccari claims that it will never be used for purposes outside of Nearby Friends.

Users can delete this data from the servers at any time by clearing their activity within settings, he adds.

For many users, the thought of Facebook collecting data about the places they visit most often is frightening, a fear Vaccari is aware of. It's one of the reasons the feature is opt-in, and a major reason you can only see and share with friends and not strangers. â€œWe are totally OK with people not wanting to opt in right away,"" he says.

Users can share their precise location with individual friends if they want to. Otherwise, friends will just see a general location. Credit: Facebook

Facebook will begin posting in users' News Feeds to encourage users to try out the service. Those who don't have Nearby Friends activated will see upsell ads, reminders that the feature is available. Those who do have the feature activated will be reminded it's turned on with similar stories that highlight who among their friends is also using the service.

CEO Mark Zuckerberg promised in January that Facebook would be launching a number of standalone apps this year, but Nearby Friends is obviously not one of them. Instead, the feature has been built into the existing Facebook flagship app in order to maximize Facebook's user base. Offering the product as a standalone app would have given Vaccari and his team more flexibility, but in order to get users on board, they wanted to go where the users already were.

Nearby Friends is only available in the United States, and will be rolling out to users slowly, a strategy Facebook often implements with new products. Both iOS and Android users will be able to get the update.

After nearly two years of working on the product, Vaccari is ready to see it in the hands of everyday users, not just Facebook employees. â€œMy hope is that people will see from their friends that there is actually a lot of value in this experience,"" he says. ""I'm curious to see how people are going to use it.""",4/17/2014 0:00,0.498818,14,1,0,4.766157,9,Tech,0,5561.917,2595.737,0,0.511408,0.11018,0.044653,0.024677,0.5125,-0.25,1600
7003394,Amazon Fire TV Voice Search Adds More Content Partners,"The voice search feature on Amazon's Fire TV is about to get a little more useful.

Amazon on Thursday announced that Hulu Plus, Crackle and Showtime Anytime are adding their full catalogs into the Fire TV's unified voice search. They will join Vevo, which already supports the feature.

Unified voice search is one of the Fire TV's most promising (and time-saving) features. The only problem -- as noted in our review of the set-top box -- is that the unified search so far only works with Amazon and Vevo content.

So unless you happen to be searching for a music video or a title Amazon carries, unified search is useless. Searching manually for a show on Hulu Plus (unless it is also carried by Amazon) or Netflix requires going inside those separate apps and using the keyboard.

Amazon says the full search catalogs for Hulu Plus, Crackle and Showtime Anywhere will arrive this summer.

The company is also working on other new features for the Fire TV, including a browser specifically for Prime Instant Video content and integration with Amazon FreeTime and Amazon MP3. More games are coming soon as well.

And if Fire TV users are lucky, Netflix will add its support for voice search in the future too.

7023167,"There's a Ford Mustang on the Empire State Building, But Good Luck Seeing It","If you put a car on the Observatory of the Empire State Building, people are going to come to see it. So itâ€™s no surprise that when Ford finally unveiled its 2015 Mustang convertible 86 stories up, there were hundreds of people packed cheek-by-jowl around it. It was, to put it simply, a mob scene.

Iâ€™d already written about how Ford did it, for the second time in 50 years, but Wednesday night was my first chance to see the proof; to ride up 86 floors (through three elevators) and stand beside the car that had been chopped up into six pieces, carted up those same elevators and rebuilt on the Empire State Buildingâ€™s iconic observation deck.

The event wasn't just a simple photo op. Ford was in the mood to celebrate, and the Empire State Buildingâ€™s 58th floor offered food, pounding music and incredible views of the city and that eveningâ€™s sunset. Ford executives mingled with journalists and guests, but there was never a moment where anyone paused to say a few words about â€œ50 years of Mustang.â€

However, there were signs everywhere of the history witnessed by the Mustang (which was actually unveiled at the 1964 World's Fair in Flushing Meadows, Queens). Each decade had its own pillar listing important milestones from the past. There was even a pair of classic Mustang pinball games. They were set for free play, so, naturally, I spent a few minutes trying to beat the high score.

Eventually, we all started to line up for access to the observation deck. Before entering the Empire State Building, I had noticed that there was a substantial line of tourists snaking around the building. None of them were up with us at the party, but I would soon discover where they all went.

The elevator ride between the party floor and the 80th floor is rather quick and we rode up, 15 at a time, packed into the small space like the Mustang parts before us. After one more brief elevator trip up to the 86th floor, we arrived, and I found the tourists.

As I turned the corner into the enclosed area that circles the building and sits just inside the exposed observation deck, I walked into a wall of journalists and families, all pushing their way toward the outside.

Though I could see a set of very bright lights in one corner of the observation deck, I couldn't find the 2015 Mustang. ""Where is it?"" I thought, ""Am I in the wrong corner?"" All I could see were people. Then, as I pushed my way through a sea of humanity, I caught a flash of yellow, and I saw it -- or at least part of it: a gleaming yellow 2015 Ford Mustang. It was positioned near one corner of the observation deck. People were pressed up against the car and a hapless Empire State Building guard was begging them not to touch or lean on it.

I cursed under my breath as I realized getting a decent photo of the car on the deck would be impossible. Slowly and deliberately I moved closer to the car and got wedged near the right rear bumper. On the other side of the car, nearest the observation deck corner, was some precious open space. I made it my mission to squeeze in there and try to get a good picture of the car in this chaotic environment.

As I got closer I noticed that while the car looked amazing, there were some subtle signs of its recent reconstruction. The left door didnâ€™t sit flush against the frame and the left hood and bumper were also out of alignment. Beyond that, youâ€™d never know it had ridden to the top in pieces.

Once I finally made it to the tiny, yet open space behind the Mustang convertible, I didnâ€™t want to leave: one, because I could finally see the car and two, because I didnâ€™t want to be squashed by the dozens of people who had the same goal as me -- seeing the car on the roof of the Empire State Building and surviving.

Eventually, I was told to leave that space because other people wanted to get in and take a selfie or two beside the car. I wormed my way out and found the elevators. I paused briefly on the 58th floor, where Ford executives were eating, drinking and dancing. I was too tired to join in and headed to the last elevator. Within minutes, I was back at street level.

I took one last look up at the Empire State Building. As on the 86th floor, I could not see a 2015 Ford Mustang from where I stood, but I did notice the top of the tower engulfed in a riot of lights. It, too, was celebrating the birthday of Ford's most iconic vehicle, with about as much restraint as I had witnessed the rest of the night.

6888884,Nobel Prize-Winning Author Gabriel Garcia Marquez Dead at 87,"Gabriel Garcia Marquez, the Nobel Prize-winning author of One Hundred Years of Solitude and Love in the Time of Cholera, has died. He was 87.

MÃ¡rquez, a native Colombian who for three decades had lived in Mexico City, was reportedly in failing health, including a recent battle with pneumonia. The AP(Opens in a new window), which first reported the death Thursday, did not list a reason for his death, which it attributed to a source close to the author and journalist's family and was later confirmed by his publisher.

SEE ALSO: The 25 Best Tumblr Accounts for Book Nerds

Garcia Marquez spent eight days in a Mexico City hospital earlier this month, and his family acknowledged later that his health was ""very fragileâ€ after he went home to convalesce. He was diagnosed with lymphatic cancer in 1999, but had said it was beaten; subsequent reports that the cancer had returned were firmly denied by his family.

Known for his magical realist novels and short stories, Garcia Marquez was a literary giant whose range and influence is nearly impossible to measure. ""One Hundred Years of Solitudeâ€ has been reprinted in more than 25 languages and sold 50 million copies since its release in 1967, making him the most widely read Latin American author in history.

Garcia Marquez never claimed to have invented the literary genre of magical realism, wherein miracles and oddities of nature coincide with everyday life. But credit due or not, he inspired dozens of copycat writers, and his name will forever be synonymous with it.

The sprawling, stream-of-consciousness style revealed the world of Latin mysticism and superstition to the world, and though he was also a prolific screenwriter, his novels were not easily translated to other mediums. ""One Hundred Years of Solitude"" was never attempted on the bigscreen, while ""Love in the Time of Cholera"" was made into a film in 2007 starring Benjamin Bratt and Javier Bardem; it made just over $30 million at the worldwide box office.

Garcia Marquez was awarded the 1982 Nobel Prize in Literature for ""Solitude,"" which was loosely based on his experiences growing up in his grandparents' home, and follows several generations of the Buendia in the fictional South American village of Macondo. While working as a journalist, he had wanted to write the book for several years until one day, he was so inspired that he cut short a family trip, sold the car and worked nearly every day for 18 months while begging and borrowing to make ends meet.

His single-mindedness was rewarded as the book became an instant hit, allowing him to move his family to Spain for the next seven years.

Garcia Marquez' instant fame led to friendships with powerful dignitaries, including Fidel Castro, with whom he shared a passion for literature. Because of his outspoken views against American imperialism, the U.S. government labeled him a subversive and denying him visas â€“ until Bill Clinton, who lists â€œSolitudeâ€ as his favorite novel, lifted the travel ban upon his election.

After witnessing the flight of Venezuelan dictator Marcos Perez Jimenez, Garcia Marquez began work on â€œAutumn of the Patriarch,â€ an amalgamation of several Latin American dictators that was finally published in 1975. He would later move his family from Barcelona to Mexico City, where lived out his remaining years with his wife and two sons.",4/17/2014 0:00,0.656,2,0,1,4.170543,6,00000,883.1667,4161.957,2555.514,2000,0.435684,0.228846,0.062016,0.023256,0.333333,0.25,3900
7023048,General Mills Legal Policy Change Spooks Facebook Fans,"UPDATE April 17, 7:05 pm ET General Mills says a New York Times(Opens in a new window) report cited in an earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that the company's legal policy change prevents consumers from suing the company if they like any of the company's brands on Facebook. This post has been updated to reflect the correction from GeneralMills.

--

General Mills faced a PR disaster Thursday after a report in The New York Times stated that liking any of the company's brands on Facebook prevents them from suing the company in court.

On Tuesday, Cheerios parent company General Mills updated the privacy policy on its website. The new language(Opens in a new window) alerts consumers that they waive their right to sue the company if they download coupons or join one of the company's ""online communities,"" which legal experts took to mean social media sites. A rep for General Mills, though, now says those communities don't include Facebook. Those who join one of the online communities are required to use informal negotiation via email or go through arbitration -- rather than the courts -- to seek relief if they have a dispute with the company.

[seealso slug=""emoji-death-threat""]

A General Mills rep offered the following statement from the company:

While it rarely happens, arbitration is an efficient way to resolve disputes -- and many companies take a similar approach. We even cover the cost of arbitration in most cases. So this is just a policy update, and weâ€™ve tried to communicate in a clear and visible way.

Law experts contacted by Mashable say they believe General Mills is the first food company to require consumers to enter into such an agreement.

However, Ann Bartow, law professor at Pace Law School, says if you, for instance, accidentally ingest a piece of glass that found its way into your box of Cheerios, you are more likely to be able to sue General Mills in court if you live in New York than other jurisdictions. That's because such consumer disputes are governed by state law, and New York laws are more consumer friendly than those of many other states. Under New York law the General Mills binding arbitration clause is not likely to be enforceable. But you still might have to go to court and get a judge to agree that the clause is unenforceable before you could bring a suit on the merits, increasing the time and costs of litigation.

Bartow adds that it's unclear if a New York-based consumer would need to go to General Mills' home state of Minnesota to argue that the case shouldn't be settled in arbitration, though. ""If you did find glass in the product, now you're not just dealing with General Mills, but you have to sue just to get into court,"" she says. Either adds court costs that the average consumer might find prohibitively expensive.

One option that's off the table is a class-action lawsuit. The 2011 Supreme Court decision AT&T Mobility v. Concepcion let companies bar consumers from banding together to sue if the companies include a standard form contract that requires that disputes be settled via one-on-one arbitration.

Companies have been crafty about getting consumers to enter into such contacts. Credit card companies and mobile phone companies embed them in their standard contract language. In 2008 fast food chain Whataburger put signs in its locations(Opens in a new window) telling consumers that by coming into the restaurants they automatically agree to use arbitration to settle disputes with the company.

Brian Fitzpatrick, a law professor at Vanderbilt, says requiring consumers to agree to class-action waivers in arbitration clauses will effectively shield corporations from offering any meaningful damages, even when they're in the wrong. ""This is a problem because a lot of these consumer fraud claims have only small damages associated with them,"" Fitzpatrick says. ""if you canâ€™t bring these claims as class actions, you wonâ€™t be able to bring them at all. (What lawyer will take a case worth $20?) This means companies will be able to escape all liability for many consumer frauds.""",4/17/2014 0:00,0.368317,13,1,0,4.637864,4,00000,479.5,3610.125,2195.299,0,0.490313,0.058497,0.032039,0.023301,0,0,12400

The new app, called simply Google Camera(Opens in a new window), features a new user interface with revamped shooting modes, as well as the ability to selectively focus the camera.

[seealso slug=""free-android-apps-every-day""]

Rumors of the new app first surfaced earlier this month after it was reported the company was testing a new camera app that would be released independently of the upcoming Android 4.4.3 update.

Google also unveiled Lens Blur, a brand new effect that enables users to shoot with a shallower depth of field to selectively focus on certain portions of a particular image. This is the first time Google has included the feature in its camera app.

""Achieving this optical effect has traditionally required a big lens and aperture, and therefore hasnâ€™t been possible using the camera on your mobile phone or tablet,"" wrote Google software Engineer Carlos Hernandez in a blog post(Opens in a new window) explaining how Google's research team created Lens Blur.

""Lens Blur replaces the need for a large optical system with algorithms that simulate a larger lens and aperture,"" he added. ""Instead of capturing a single photo, you move the camera in an upward sweep to capture a whole series of frame.""

The camera's panorama and portrait sphere modes have also been improved with higher resolution. Google Camera is also the first time the company has made portrait sphere, a shooting mode that that enables 360 degree panoramas, available to non-Nexus devices.

The app also features an enlarged shutter button and viewfinder, so what users see in the viewfinder will be what comes out in the shot.

7003340,Why Science Fiction Is the Wrong Model for Imagining the Future,"Self-driving cars, extreme life extension, and global wifi provided by weather balloons(Opens in a new window): Google makes projects that sound like science fiction into reality at its secretive research lab, Google X.

And that may be exactly the problem.

Google finally allowed a journalist, Fast Company's Jon Gertner,to profile Google X(Opens in a new window). His report is on newsstands (at least digital ones)(Opens in a new window) today. The most interesting strategic detail he gleaned was Google's process for selecting Google X projects:

[T]here are three criteria that X projects share. All must address a problem that affects millions -- or better yet, billions -- of people. All must utilize a radical solution that has at least a component that resembles science fiction. And all must tap technologies that are now (or very nearly) obtainable. But to [Rich] DeVaul, the head of Rapid Eval, there's another, more unifying principle that connects the three criteria: No idea should be incremental.

(Emphasis added.)

A lot of people might read that line and think: Wow, cool, Google is trying to make the future!

But ""science fiction"" provides but a tiny porthole onto the vast strangeness of the future. When we imagine a ""science fiction""-like future, I think we tend to picture completed worlds, flying cars, the shiny, floating towers of midcentury dreams.

We tend, in other words, to imagine future technological systems as readymade, holistic products that people will choose to adopt, rather than as the assembled work of countless different actors, which they've always really been. The futurist Scott Smith(Opens in a new window) calls these 'flat-pack futures(Opens in a new window),' and they infect ""science fictional"" thinking.

Science fiction, too, can underestimate the importance and role of social change. For every feminist science fiction writer or Afrofuturist, there is a still better-known member of the genre's far-right. The writer David Forbes, in fact, asked for support earlier this year so he could investigate the great influence of science fiction's extreme conservatives(Opens in a new window).

Wrote Forbes at the time(Opens in a new window):

Sci-fi's popular history doesn't mention John Campbell's belief that race riots were caused by ""genetic barbarians"" or Robert Heinlein's fondness for robber barons and military rule. It remembers Larry Niven's creative alien worlds, not his advocacy of lying to immigrants to deny them healthcare. Jerry Pournelle is widely hailed as the dean of military sci-fi, his sympathies for fascists like Franco and Pinochet forgotten.

Google X, obviously, isn't to blame for science fiction's reactionary inheritance. But a science fictional imagination is prone to these sorts of myopia. I fear -- especially when we talk about ""science fiction"" -- that we miss the layeredness of the world, that many people worked to build it.

In his article, Gertner expands on Google X's aversion to incrementalism:

The rejection of incrementalism, he says, is not because he and his colleagues believe it's pointless for ideological reasons. They believe it for practical reasons. ""It's so hard to do almost anything in this world,"" [DeVaul] says. ""Getting out of bed in the morning can be hard for me. But attacking a problem that is twice as big or 10 times as big is not twice or 10 times as hard.""

DeVaul insists that it's often just as easy, or easier, to make inroads on the biggest problems ""than to try to optimize the next 5 percent or 2 percent out of some process.""

This strikes me as an intriguing assertion, and I want to think more about it. But it's certain that some causes -- especially social ones -- can only be advanced incrementally; and some technologies -- especially systemic ones -- can only be constructed the same way.

I'm reminded of my colleague Rebecca Rosen's interview with Radia Perlman(Opens in a new window), whose invention of the spanning-tree protocol made the modern Internet possible. Perlman is often called the ""Mother of the Internet"" for her work, a title which she eschews. She explained why(Opens in a new window) she doesn't like it:

There are lots of people who like to take credit for it, and it drives them crazy when anyone other than them seems to want credit, so it seems best to just stay out of their way. I did indeed make some fundamental contributions to the underlying infrastructure, but no single technology really caused the Internet to succeed. And sometimes, things get invented multiple times until the time just happens to be right.

7023201,Heartbleed Aftershock: The New Certificate Threat,"Ten days after the Heartbleed bug was first revealed to the public, companies are scrambling to patch servers and update software. But the crisis isn't over.

It's not enough for companies to simply patch the copy of OpenSSL -- the software at the root of the Heartbleed bug. Companies must also revoke and reissue digital certificates for their Heartbleed-vulnerable sites. And the clock is ticking.

The DL on digital certificates

A digital certificate -- often called an SSL certificate -- is most commonly used by a web browser to validate that a web server is secure. The website applies for a certificate with a certification authority (CA) as a way to prove the site is who it says it is. This certificate shows that website X is connected with a specific name, email and DNS address, which helps ""prove"" its identity.

The green lock icon you see on your web browser shows that a valid SSL certificate is present and indicates that a site is who it says it is and it's safe to use.

This green icon indicates that a website is protected by a digital certificate and is who it says it is. Credit: Google

The certificate authority (CA) looks for the presence of private keys on a website server to verify its identity. As a result, the security of these private keys are extremely important. The biggest potential threat from Heartbleed aren't user names and passwords -- but access to those private keys. If someone could grab those private keys, they could use them to make changes to the certificate or masquerade one site as having the identity of another -- a potential gold mine for phishing scams.

Last week, the content delivery network CloudFlare challenged users to steal its private key from an unpatched server on its network to figure out just how big a threat Heartbleed really was. The results were clear(Opens in a new window): Within hours, multiple user were successfully able to extract private keys from a vulnerable server.

Reissue and revoke

According to security services firm Netcraft, more than 500,000(Opens in a new window) certificates are vulnerable to Heartbleed.

Every single one of those certificates needs to be reissued and revoked. That process has started, but it might not be happening fast enough. As of Tuesday morning, Netcraft reported that 80,000 certificates(Opens in a new window) have been revoked.

Certificate authorities (CA) such as Symantec and Comodo are rushing to reissue and revoke certificates for its clients. Comodo's CTO Robin Alden told PC Pro(Opens in a new window) that its renewal rates have ""gone up by a factor of between 15 and 20.""

As of Thursday, more than 130,000 certificates have been revoked, according to ISC's CRL activity tracker(Opens in a new window). The vast majority of those revocations were issued on April 16 and April 17.

This chart from the ISC shows the number of security certificates revoked since Heartbleed was made public. Credit: ISC

Not only do companies need to reissue new certificates, they need to revoke the old certificates so that they will no longer work. As Netcraft details, the revocation process(Opens in a new window) has its problems. Still, the firm notes that it's critical.

CloudFlare announced Thursday that it had completed its process(Opens in a new window) of reissuing and revoking SSL certificates that it manages for its customers. The company also provided technical details on how private keys can leak.

Using CA list prices, Netcraft estimates that the cost of replacing all the potentially compromised certificates with brand new certificates could cost $100 million. Fortunately, most CAs -- including Comodo -- are not charging customers to reissue and revoke their old certificates.

In the immediate wake of Heartbleed, some companies opted to simply buy new certificates rather than going through the reissue process. Regardless, the old certificates still need to be revoked. And unfortunately, that isn't always happening.

Netcraft sums up the current situation:

While some companies quickly recognised the need to issue new certificates(Opens in a new window) in response to the Heartbleed bug, the number of revocations has not kept up. This is a mistake, as there is little point issuing a new certificate if an attacker is still able to impersonate a website with the old one.

Yahoo was one of the first companies to deploy new SSL certificates after the Heartbleed bug became public knowledge, but the certificate that was previously used by mlogin.yahoo.com has not yet been revoked â€” it has not been placed on a CRL, and the certificate's OCSP responder says the certificate is ""good"".

Yahoo is not the only company to have issued a new certificate without ensuring that the previously vulnerable certificate has been revoked. Other sites which fall into this category include banking websites (such as entry7.credit-suisse.ch), the United States Senate large file transfer system at lfts.senate.gov, and GeoTrust's SSL Toolbox at https://ssltools.geotrust.com/checker/(Opens in a new window)(GeoTrust is a brand owned by Symantec, the largest certificate authority).

Some might argue that the chances of a site's keys being stolen before a server was patched might be low enough to not require immediate action. That might be true, but that's not a risk any major business or institution should be willing to take.

Broader Internet impact

One of the problems with reissuing and revoking so many digital certificates at once is the impact it has on the broader Internet.

Web browsers check a site's digital certificate against a list of invalidated certificates maintained by each publicly trusted CA. These certificate revocation lists (CRLs) are usually downloaded by your web browser. Because websites rarely change their certificates, the lists are often short -- and the downloads have little visible impact.

The problem that we're going to face now -- and it's a problem that's only going to increase as more companies revoke their certificates -- is that this means that those CRL lists are about to get a bunch of new entries really, really quickly.

The current size of all CRLs used by publicly trusted authorities is about 100MB in size. Netcraft says the CRLs will grow by 35% if all certificates affected by Heartbleed are revoked. That's a lot of data for browsers to download, particularly for mobile devices.

Moreover, policies and industry standards dictate that CAs are supposed to provide a response (that is ""yes, this is safe, or no this is revoked"") in less than 10 seconds.

Changes made to even one site can require browsers to download tons of new data. This is especially true when it comes to government CRLs.

From Netcraft(Opens in a new window):

The largest CRL (11MB) is operated by the US Department of the Treasury, and despite containing more than 200,000 revocation entries, it is only used by one publicly accessible certificate. Nonetheless, any browser wishing to perform a CRL check for that one site will have to download the whole list. Governments also feature amongst the worst-performing CRLs: For example, the Taiwanese government offers a CRL at http://hcaocsp.nat.gov.tw/repository/HCA/CRL/complete.crl(Opens in a new window), which would not respond when tested earlier today, and the Brazilian government offers several CRLs from its site at repositorio.icpbrasil.gov.br, but each took 2-3 minutes to download, despite being of relatively modest sizes.

According to CloudFlare(Opens in a new window), the CRL from its primary CA (Globalsign) grew from 22KB on Monday to 4.7MB as of Thursday. The bandwidth associated with every browser downloading that new CRL, 40Gbps.

So as more companies revoke certificates, expect the CRL load to balloon even more. This will inevitably lead to a slowdown across the web.

But really, what's the alternative? Companies could stagger the revocation process, as a way to prevent traffic slowdowns, but that still comes with a cost: security and piece of mind.

Speaking to The Washington Post(Opens in a new window), cybersecurity scholar Jason Healey sums up the situation quite well, ""What's the other solution? Ask people to be vulnerable for longer? That doesn't strike me as particularly reasonable.""

The certificate revocation process has had major issues for years. Perhaps Heartbleed can lead to some real work on making the process more reliable and more secure, so that in the future, mass revocations won't be as difficult.

5834112,5 Innovations That Will Transform India in the Next 5 Years,"MUMBAI, India â€” Following the United States and China, India is the worldâ€™s third largest Internet population. The country is projected to be home to 243 million Internet users by June 2014 -â€“ but thatâ€™s still only a fraction of the countryâ€™s 1.2 billion population.

As access to the Internet penetrates deeper into the Indian population, it is changing the ways politicians campaign, companies lead and people connect.

[seealso slug=""holi""]

Mashable was in Mumbai last week to explore the influence connectivity is having on the country at the first-ever India +SocialGood(Opens in a new window) conference. The event brought together more than 400 members of Indiaâ€™s technology, social media and non-profit communities for a day of exchanging ideas and networking. More than one million people participated in the social discussions and joined the event via Livestream.

Here are five key takeaways from the event, which dive into the countryâ€™s powerful online potential.

1. 4G is changing the game.

Can you imagine more than 1 billion people with access to the fastest possible mobile Internet? That will be the reality in India in a matter of years. India relies primarily on mobile devices for digital communications, and thatâ€™s certainly not going to change anytime soon.

Indiaâ€™s first 4G network arrived in April 2012 in Kolkata, West Bengal. Since then, 4G has slowly spread throughout the country. This February, Apple made a joint announcement with Bharti Airtel that it would bring 4G mobile service to users of Appleâ€™s latest phones in Bangalore.

To date, 4G access has been primarily data-only. As 4G becomes more widespread and accessible for all types of devices, the potential increases for digital communications, online media, both large and small businesses, entrepreneurship and mobile commerce. Many +SocialGood community members expressed particular excitement about future opportunities for mobile commerce and peer-to-peer lending.

2. 100 million people connected on Facebook.

On April 9, the same day as the event, Facebook reported it had crossed the 100 million users mark in India, making it the second largest country on the social network, behind only the United States, where the company started. However, 100 million users is still just a small percentage of Indiaâ€™s overall population, and the market still has potential for significant growth.

What you hear and see in Mumbai is that, in many ways, Facebook is the gateway to the Internet. For instance, many small businesses have forgone original websites and sites such as Yelp, instead focusing on building out their company Facebook pages.

India may also be the biggest reason that Facebook acquired the messaging service WhatsApp for $16 billion. It is an extremely popular service as it works across all smartphones using low amounts of data, unlike SMS/text messages, and is nearly free. It also offers several features such as group messaging and audio and video messaging using little data, making it by far the easiest and cheapest way to stay in touch and share information with others both domestically and internationally.

3. Social media as a political force

Social media is playing a major role in the Indian national elections for the first time.

The Bharatiya Janata Party has largely adopted social media in this election cycle, creating several campaign activations for its candidate for Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The candidate has a strong presence across platforms such as YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Google+ and Indiaâ€™s own social media platform Vebbler.

Holograms of Modi were shown at rallies, and Google+ Hangouts were used to interact with the movementâ€™s supporters. Modi currently has 3.4 million Twitter followers and over 10.6 million â€œlikesâ€ on his Facebook page.

As weâ€™ve seen in other elections around the world, social media has the potential to play a big role. It is very unclear how this will shape the current election in India, as Rahul Gandhi, the incumbent National Congress Partyâ€™s candidate for Prime Minister, doesnâ€™t yet have a verified Twitter account. Many are comparing the contrast of social media strategies in this election to the 2008 U.S. presidential race between Barack Obama and John McCain.

But one thing is clear: With the rise of social networks in the country, more young people are getting involved in the election. As we have seen in the United States, this yearâ€™s race could be the tipping point that will never again allow an Indian national election to go without social media campaigns.

4. The new 2% giving mandate

The Companies Act was enacted April 1, the start of Indiaâ€™s fiscal year. The mandate requires that one-third of a companyâ€™s board is comprised of independent directors. This board committee must ensure the company spends â€œat least 2% of the average net profits of the company made during the three immediately preceding financial yearsâ€ on corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives. Conservative estimates calculate this will net $2.5 billion annually. If the company fails to spend this amount on CSR, the board must disclose why in its annual report.

The act defines CSR as activities that promote poverty reduction, education, health, environmental sustainability, gender equality and vocational skills development. Companies can choose which area to invest in, or contribute the amount to central or state government funds earmarked for socioeconomic development.

The CSR legislation was a big topic of conversation among the businesspeople and NGO workers at India +SocialGood. How this new mandate will work, and what the total result of the giving will be is uncertain, but what is clear is that both sides are working to ensure accountability, transparency and measurement, and social media can help play a major role.

5. Women sitting on corporate boards, by law

Another part of â€œThe Companies Actâ€ mandates that corporations' boards of directors include at least one female member. While U.S. media writes countless op-eds and Twitter buzzes about getting more women to the top, India has taken a proactive legal step to make it a reality.

Reports indicate fewer than 30% of Indiaâ€™s female population is active in the workforce, but the new legislation is a significant first step in incentivizing and rewarding professional women across India. While it canâ€™t be known what the long-term effects of this mandate will be, in theory, the law will provide opportunities for millions of Indian women to take on high-level management and strategy positions across the nationâ€™s top industries.

Last year, 16.9% of board seats in the United States were held by women, a relatively low number compared to the 27% of Swedish board seats and 40.9% of Norwegian board seats held by women. However, in India, women hold only 4.7% of corporate board positions, a statistic significantly lower than in western nations.

By introducing the female board member mandate, India has the potential to not only grow its female working population, but to increase the value and importance of female leadership culturally and socially across the nation.

7003332,"Tapping Into the Emotional Side of Video Games: Developing Hope, Healing and Love","""Video games have always been a part of my life,"" said Jenova Chen. ""I always played games with my friends, but as I got older, my friends stopped playing.""

Chen, president and co-founder of thatgamecompany(Opens in a new window), wondered why that was. While his friends said they were too busy, it wasn't that they didn't have time for other forms of entertainment.

""People still read novels, watched movies, listened to music,"" he said. ""The fact that most of my friends are abandoning games makes me feel sad. How can I help video games not just be for kids, and respected from people of all ages and genders? My dream is to make everyone love video games.""

Chen's hypothesis on how to solve this problem came about when he began studying at the University of Southern California's Interactive Media Division. He felt games, which originally came from a software background, divided their genres based on technology they were built around, such as massively multiplayer online games or first-person shooters. Entertainment genres, however, are divided based on emotions: romantic comedies, action, horror, drama. Chen noticed the range of emotions games catered to only fit certain genres, those generally popular with a young and male audience.

""Look at the genres women like: a romantic comedy game doesn't exist. Few examples of a documentary game exist. What is the equivalent of a real drama game? They don't exist,"" Chen said. ""Emotion with that complexity for a more mature, older audience are necessary to make medium like video games healthy, so it can be highly respected like the film industry.""

But the goal is deeper than respect; Chen hopes that creating games with real emotional weight will improve people's lives. He and thatgamecompany have already seen success with their titles like FlOw, Flower, Cloud and Journey, which offer non-traditional gaming experiences that are highly interactive and emotionally engaging.

Journey in particular has had strong emotional reactions from fans, which Chen plans to detail in his upcoming talk for the Games for Change Festival(Opens in a new window), running April 22-26 in New York City. The 2012 PlayStation 3 game follows a mysterious hooded figure on its journey to reach the top of a mountain, through a dessert, a palace, dark caves and treacherous snow. While the experience itself is only two to three hours long, very different from normal games, it focuses more on the sense of wonder players experience during the trip.

After releasing Journey, Chen said he was flooded with very emotional responses from players around the world. He recounted one veteran, disabled in combat, saying the game gave him hope and a desire to go out and live again.

Others used the game to deal with grieving and loss, he said. During Journey, players can be joined by another random online player, dressed in the same robe and hood. That player can help them along and communicate in limited ways, but their identity is completely anonymous. Chen said he received several letters from players dealing with the loss of a loved one where they had imagined that person was playing Journey with them. That projection helped them cope.

""I would never expected that, and wouldn't have believed it would happen if we didn't receive six or seven unrelated letters from around the world with very similar stories,"" Chen said.

""These games have more meaning than just pleasure, or just a moment of escape. There is more power in these games when you are doing it right. I think certain types of feelings can heal and change people, can make their lives better,"" Chen said. ""Now we have refined our mission statement. We want to make positive change to the human psyche worldwide, even if you just think it's just entertainment.""

To make that experience perfect, and to make sure players get the optimal emotional experience, Chen's team relies on feedback during playtesting. Journey's development took three years, he said, because the team had to change the design of the game to assure everyone got the same experience.

The online multiplayer element was the thing causing all the trouble. Since companionship is a big theme of the game, Chen needed to make sure players acted like the right type of companions online.

""For quite a while we had players being very mean to each other. People are really aggressive in many other games online. When the same player playing Call of Duty came over to Journey, we were expecting to reveal a positive side of humanity rather than a nasty side, but it didn't happen.""

Part of the limited character interactions originally let characters physically touch each other with pushes or bumps. Players could even jump on each other's heads to reach higher obstacles. What happened was that playtesters would use that ability to shove other players, even going so far as to push other players in a pit so they would die, and the game ""turned into people killing each other on a cliff.""

""For a while we were disappointed in our playtesters, but then I realized our developers like to do it, too,"" Chen said. ""The players aren't evil; the system just rewards that evil behavior.""

Instead, Chen said players in a new game are basically babies. They come with a fresh moral slate and are just seeking feedback, similar to how an infant would. He explained an analogy a child psychologist had taught him, about a baby hitting the kitchen table with a spoon.

""The baby doesn't understand what it's doing; it wants feedback. If the baby is making noise and its parents run in to the room, it looks at that is positive feedback rather than negative. They like it more, so they will make it louder,"" Chen said. ""Pushing off the cliff is maximum feedback, so we realized we had to redesign the system.""

Chen will deliver his talk, titled ""Blank Canvas: Designing a New Era of Emotional Storytelling Through Games""(Opens in a new window) on April 24 at NYU's Skirball Center for Performing Arts as part of the Games for Change Festival.

6592338,Scientists Discover 'Earth Cousin' Planet That Could Support Life,"For the first time, scientists have discovered an Earth-size alien planet in the habitable zone of its host star, an ""Earth cousin"" that just might have liquid water and the right conditions for life.

The newfound planet, called Kepler-186f, was first spotted by NASA's Kepler space telescope and circles a dim red dwarf star about 490 light-years from Earth. While the host star is dimmer than Earth's sun and the planet is slightly bigger than Earth, the positioning of the alien world coupled with its size suggests that Kepler-186f could have water on its surface, scientists say. You can learn more about the amazing alien planet find in a video(Opens in a new window) produced by Space.com.

""One of the things we've been looking for is maybe an Earth twin, which is an Earth-size planet in the habitable zone of a sunlike star,"" Tom Barclay, Kepler scientist and co-author of the new exoplanet research, told Space.com. ""This [Kepler-186f(Opens in a new window)] is an Earth-size planet in the habitable zone of a cooler star. So, while it's not an Earth twin, it is perhaps an Earth cousin. It has similar characteristics, but a different parent."" [9 Exoplanets That Could Host Alien Life(Opens in a new window)]

Potentially habitable planet

Scientists think that Kepler-186f -- the outermost of five planets found to be orbiting the star Kepler-186 -- orbits at a distance of 32.5 million miles, theoretically within the habitable zone for a red dwarf.

Earth orbits the sun from an average distance of about 93 million miles, but the sun is larger and brighter than the Kepler-186 star, meaning that the sun's habitable zone begins farther out from the star by comparison to Kepler-186.

""This is the first definitive Earth-sized planet found in the habitable zone around another star,"" Elisa Quintana, of the SETI Institute and NASA's Ames Research Center and the lead author of a new study detailing the findings, said in a statement.

Other planets of various sizes have been found in the habitable zones(Opens in a new window) of their stars. However, Kepler-186f is the first alien planet this close to Earth in size found orbiting in that potentially life-supporting area of an extrasolar system, according to exoplanet scientists.

""An historic discovery""

""This is an historic discovery of the first truly Earth-size planet found in the habitable zone around its star,"" Geoff Marcy, an astronomer at the University of California, Berkeley, who is unaffiliated with the research, told Space.com via email. ""This is the best case for a habitable planet yet found. The results are absolutely rock-solid. The planet itself may not be, but I'd bet my house on it. In any case, it's a gem.""

The newly discovered planet measures about 1.1 Earth radii, making it slightly larger than Earth(Opens in a new window), but researchers still think the alien world may be rocky like Earth. Researchers still aren't sure what Kepler-186f's atmosphere is made of, a key element that could help scientists understand if the planet is hospitable to life.

""What we've learned, just over the past few years, is that there is a definite transition which occurs around about 1.5 Earth radii,"" Quintana said in a statement. ""What happens there is that for radii between 1.5 and 2 Earth radii, the planet becomes massive enough that it starts to accumulate a very thick hydrogen and helium atmosphere, so it starts to resemble the gas giants of our solar system rather than anything else that we see as terrestrial.""

The edge of habitability

Kepler-186f actually lies at the edge of the Kepler-186 star's habitable zone, meaning that liquid water on the planet's surface could freeze, according to study co-author Stephen Kane of San Francisco State University.

Because of its position in the outer part of the habitable zone, the planet's larger size could actually help keep its water liquid, Kane said in a statement. Since it is slightly bigger than Earth, Kepler-186f could have a thicker atmosphere, which would insulate the planet and potentially keep its water in liquid form, Kane added.

""It [Kepler-186f] goes around its star over 130 days, but because its star is a lower mass than our sun, the planet orbits slightly inner of where Mercury orbits in our own solar system,"" Barclay said. ""It's on the cooler edge of the habitable zone. It's still well within it, but it receives less energy than Earth receives. So, if you're on this planet [Kepler-186f], the star would appear dimmer.""

Exoplanet hunting in the future

Kepler-186f could be too dim for follow-up studies that would probe the planet's atmosphere. NASA's James Webb Space Telescope(Opens in a new window) -- Hubble's successor, expected to launch to space in 2018 -- is designed to image planets around relatively nearby stars; however, the Kepler-186 system might be too far off for the powerful telescope to investigate, Barclay said.

Scientists using the Kepler telescope(Opens in a new window) discovered Kepler-186f using the transit method: When the planet moved across the face of its star from the telescope's perspective, Kepler recorded a slight dip in the star's brightness, allowing researchers to learn more about the planet itself. Kepler suffered a major malfunction last year and is no longer working in the same fashion, but scientists are still going through the spacecraft's trove of data searching for new alien worlds.

""I find it simply awesome that we live in a time when finding potentially habitable planets is common, and the method to find them is standardized,"" MIT exoplanet hunter and astrophysicist Sara Seager, who is unaffiliated with the research, told Space.com via email.",4/17/2014 0:00,0.471198,18,1,0,5.041002,5,00000,1620.43,4475.922,2905.663,766,0.363867,-0.09859,0.014806,0.018223,1,-0.25,7400
7023106,Brooklyn Net Andrei Kirilenko Is Bringing Russia Its First Hooters,"Amid simmering tensions between the Kremlin and the White House, can Russians and Americans find any cultural common ground?

NBA player Andrei Kirilenko of the Brooklyn Nets thinks there's one place where Russia and the West can put politics aside. That place is Hooters, which Kirilenko is introducing to his home country by opening Russia's first franchise of the notorious -- and quintessentially American -- boobs-and-buffalo wings chain in Moscow later this month.

[seealso url = ""http://mashable.com/2014/04/16/landon-donovan""]

Kirilenko says the cultural chasm isn't as wide as some might think.

â€œRussians and Americans are more alike than different -- huge sports fans who are looking for great food and good times,â€ he told Bloomberg(Opens in a new window) this week. â€œWhen youâ€™ve got waitresses that look like ours, itâ€™s a slam dunk.""

Kirilenko, who joined the NBA in 2001 after learning basketball and becoming a star in Russia, is nicknamed AK-47 for his Russian heritage and the number he wears on the court. He turned down a lucrative contract with the Minnesota Timberwolves last year to sign for less money with the Nets, a team owned by Russian billionaire and titan of industry Mikhail Prokhorov. Signing for less money -- he took a $7 million pay cut -- with Brooklyn prompted rampant speculation among fans that Kirilenko and Prokhorov had worked out some sort of under-the-table arrangement.

Side-deals or not, Kirilenko now has an additional revenue stream in Hooters. His new spot is slated to open April 28 and will include 40 flat-screen TVs for sports-watching as well as a gift shop featuring the Hooters merchandise Russians don't yet know they need.

Kirilenko's Hooters will also, of course, revolve around the scantily clad waitresses that have made the chain a hit with some and offensive to others. Russian swimsuit model Irina Shayk has even signed on to ""become Hooter Girl for a week"" when it opens, according to the Hooters Russia(Opens in a new window) Facebook page.

Nonetheless, Kirlenko told Bloomberg his new business venture's biggest obstacle will be convincing people that it's not ""a strip bar.""

And for those quick to see the irony in Hooters coming to Russia during escalated tensions between the American and Russian governments, Kirilenko has a simple retort: ""What do politics have to do with a sports bar?""

Sometimes, Andrei, nothing and everything at the same time.

7023117,Mathematicians' New App May Have the Answer for Jet Lag,"Jet lag is a discomfort many of us will have experienced in the days following a long-haul flight across time zones. Mathematicians in the US may have a jet-lag cure in the form a new app called Entrain(Opens in a new window). But does it work?

Our circadian clock, which drives daily 24-hour rhythms in our physiology and behavior, is to blame for jet lag. It cannot instantly reset to the destination time zone and the adjusting process can take a number of days. The rate at which our clocks reset depends upon a number of factors including the number of time zones crossed, the direction of travel (east or west) and the light exposure experienced before and upon arrival.

The aspect of jet lag that affects us most is the disruption it causes to our sleep. We can experience problems both falling and staying asleep, as well as waking up when we need to, such that our sleep tends to be short in duration and poor in quality. This then negatively affects our daytime levels of alertness and ability to perform cognitive and physical tasks.

The power of light

Light is the most effective stimulus for altering the timing of our circadian clock and synchronizing it appropriately to the local light/dark cycle and desired wake/sleep schedule. By exposing yourself to light at appropriate times of day, it is possible to trick your body into adjusting to the right rhythm and minimize the occurrence, duration and impact of jet lag.

The reference point for light exposure is the time that your body temperature is at its lowest â€“ this normally occurs about two hours before you wake up. Exposure to light before this point will push your clock later in time (required when flying westwards) whereas light after your lowest temperature time will bring your clock earlier in time (required for eastwards travel).

One method of adaptation to the new time zone is to gradually adjust your body clock to the destination time zone before you fly by progressively altering your sleeping patterns and using bright light in the days before your trip. If pre-adjustment is not possible (or convenient), then you can help your clock adapt upon arrival by scheduling your exposure to light and dark. Trying to calculate a light/dark schedule, and adjust this as your clock adapts, around your work or holiday plans can be a bit of a headache. This is where the app may be able to help.

Training your body clock

The Entrain app, developed at the University of Michigan, uses mathematical models to calculate the most effective way of adapting to a new time zone for you. It generates a customized schedule of light and darkness to be followed upon arrival on the basis of information you provide about your light exposure history, typical sleep schedule at home and your itinerary, in terms of expected time indoors and outdoors, while away. If you deviate from the planned schedule then you can just tell the app and it will revise prescriptions accordingly.

The researchers state that instead of gradually shifting the clock to the required time zone, their app will rapidly push our clocks to where it needs to be -- faster than the one hour per day that has been the general consensus in the field. The authors state that continuous light has the most impact on the bodyâ€™s circadian system and that simply adjusting the time of dawn and dusk through exposing our bodies to light is both practical, easy to follow and efficient. This is very different to current advice which schedules bright light for short periods relative to your lowest body temperature point.

Speeding up the rate of adaptation to a new time zone is clearly advantageous. But, although these schedules are mathematically proven(Opens in a new window), they now need real human data to support them. The models appear to be primarily based on data obtained in the highly controlled, artificial environment of a laboratory, and it will be interesting to see how these translate to the real world.

It is also unclear whether the app takes into account the fact that every cell of the body has its own circadian clock coordinated by the master circadian clock in our brains. Following travel across time zones, many of the biological disturbances we experience from jet lag are due to the clocks in our various organs and tissues re-synchronizing at different rates. Thus, the app may rapidly synchronize your brain clock but your physiology may be lagging behind so you may still suffer certain symptoms of jet lag due to this internal dissociation.

As the public starts to use this app they will provide the necessary feedback that will be crucial for validating the mathematical models used. Users can submit their data to the appâ€™s creators at the University of Michigan, along with feedback about their jet lag symptoms, in order to build better models that may accelerate the process of overcoming jet lag.",4/17/2014 0:00,0.592841,33,20,9,5.078838,10,00000,0,10787.7,4601.988,7950,0.564478,0.215109,0.039419,0.008299,1,0,12000

7023087,Centipede Claws Its Way Out of the Snake That Ate It,"A group of researchers stumbled upon a grisly scene during a field study in Macedonia last year: a dead nose-horned viper with a centipede's head sticking out of its ruptured abdomen.

After a post-mortem, the scientists think it's possible that the centipede quite literally eviscerated the snake from the inside out.

The remnants of the death match were discovered on May 14, 2013, on Golem Grad, an island in Lake Prespa, and described last month in a brief report published in the journal Ecologica Montenegrina(Opens in a new window).

The unfortunate nose-horned viper (Vipera ammodytes) was a young female that stretched about 2 inches longer than the centipede (7.9 vs. 6 inches). But the centipede (Scolopendra cingulate) was actually heavier than the snake, tipping the scales at 114% of the snake's body weight (0.17 vs. 0.14 ounces).

Nose-horned vipers regularly take on small mammals, lizards and birds, and they've been known to eat centipedes successfully, too. But in this particular case, the snake ""gravely underestimated"" the size and strength of its prey, the scientist wrote.

A dissection revealed that the snake's visceral organs(Opens in a new window) were missing, or in other words, ""the entire volume of its body was occupied by the centipede,"" the scientists wrote. For this reason, the researchers think it's possible the snake's dinner tried to claw its way out, destroying the viper's internal organs along the way, before eventually dying.",4/17/2014 0:00,0.51699,4,2,1,4.83293,8,Tech,0,4100,2552.622,1730.667,0.441688,0.144459,0.038741,0.024213,0,0,1400

The trailer begins with Piper Chapman (Taylor Schilling) in solitary confinement, a place she now calls home, thanks to a bloody brawl with Pennsatucky at the end of season one. We also get a glimpse at Morello replacing her jumpsuit with a wedding dress, and Red confronting an old friend, of sorts.

There's also a new gal behind bars, who sums up how we pretty much all feel: ""This is not how I imagined prison to be at all.""

The first season was a runaway hit for Netflix, which is submitting the show for consideration in the Emmy's ""comedy"" category this year. The 13-episode second season will be available for streaming in its entirety beginning June 6.

7023100,Pamphlets Urging Jews to Register in Ukraine Are Likely Fake,"Jewish groups, politicians, members of the media, White House advisors, the U.S. Secretary of State, and the U.S. ambassador(Opens in a new window) to Ukraine are concerned over a pamphlet that says Jews in eastern Ukraine must register with the local pro-Russia militia forces.

The pamphlet, which was handed to Jews who were leaving a Donesk-area synagogue by three unidentified men wearing ski masks and holding the flag of the Russian Federation, contains an appeal addressed to ""Ukraine citizens of Jewish nationality"" that requests all people of Jewish descent report to local administrative building and register there.

Pro-Russian leaflets dropped in Donetsk order Jews in east Ukraine to register, says @USATODAY(Opens in a new window) http://t.co/rlT8Yi4a6P(Opens in a new window) pic.twitter.com/sDCyhmE8Le(Opens in a new window)â€” Conor Finnegan (@ConorCNN) April 17, 2014(Opens in a new window)

It left many of the 15,000 Jews of Donetsk â€œshocked and hysterical,â€ the chief rabbi of the city told The Daily Beast(Opens in a new window), pointing out where one of the leaflets had been left on a tree outside his synagogue on Oktiabskaya Street.

Ben Rhodes, President Obama's deputy national security adviser, says the reports are ""chilling, outrageous and must be universally condemned."" U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, speaking on Thursday, said, ""In the year 2014 after all of the miles traveled and all of the journey of history this is not just intolerable, itâ€™s grotesque.""

Grotesque, yes. Condemned, definitely. But some are questioning its authenticity.

The man whose signature graces the pamphlet says it's not a real document; it's just agitprop that was handed out by ""some idiots"" who were hoping to create a conflict and then ""blame the attack on separatists"" in the region.

Denis Pushilin, the so-called â€œpeopleâ€™s governor"" of Donetsk, told local reporters(Opens in a new window), ""Some idiots yesterday were giving out these flyers in targeted areas."" He criticized the website that is being sourced by media outlets, and denied his organization was behind the stunt. It's likely the work of provocateurs(Opens in a new window).

The document was originally posted by Ukrainian website novosti.dn.ua(Opens in a new window), and then picked up by USA Today(Opens in a new window), the Israeli website Ynet News(Opens in a new window), and a stream(Opens in a new window) of(Opens in a new window) reporters(Opens in a new window) who followed up with tweets that furthered the troubling report.

If it were real, the pamphlet would be a troubling sign that a new phase of anti-semitic fascism in the region nearly 60 years since the Soviet liberation of Auschwitz.

Even if not, it's clear officials are wary of a rise in anti-semitism in the region. Of four-party talks that took place in Geneva, Switzerland on Thursday, Kerry said(Opens in a new window), ""The parties agreed today that all sides must refrain from the use of violence, intimidation, or provocative actions. And we strongly condemned and rejected all expressions of extremism, racism, and religious intolerance, including anti-Semitism.""

And its true that Ukraine's Right Sector includes(Opens in a new window) anti-semites and extreme nationalists.

But in a statement sent to Mashable on Thursday afternoon, the Anti-Defamation League questioned its authenticity, while condemning the ""cynical"" messaging it contained.

""The ADL today condemned the appearance of anti-Semitic fliers in Donetsk, Ukraine, and called on all parties involved in the political conflicts in Ukraine to refrain from 'cynical and politically manipulative' exploitation of anti-Semitism,"" said Abraham H. Foxman, ADL National Director.

""We are skeptical about the flierâ€™s authenticity, but the instructions clearly recall the Nazi era and have the effect of intimidating the local Jewish community,"" he said.

â€œWe have seen a series of cynical and politically manipulative uses and accusations of anti-Semitism in Ukraine over the past year,â€ said Mr. Foxman. â€œThe perpetrators and their targets are opposing politicians and political movements, but the true victims are the Jewish communities. We strongly condemn the anti-Semitic content, but also all attempts to use anti-Semitism for political purposes.â€

NCSJ: Advocates on Behalf of Jews in Russia, Ukraine, the Baltic States & Eurasia, a group that advocates on behalf of the estimated 1.5 million Jews living in the 15 successor states of the former Soviet Union, also says it has contacted the Donetsk Jewish community leaders(Opens in a new window), who are saying the official-looking flyers is intended to incite conflict.

""NCSJ has contacted the Donetsk Jewish community leaders, who called the flyers a provocation. They said that all authorities have denied any connection to the flyers, and that Pushilin has denied authorship,"" the NCSJ says. ""Several members of the community went to the Nationalities Commissioner, who repudiated the flyer, and said that the leaflets were distributed to cause unrest among the Jewish population.""

The group adds that similar leaflets have been distributed targeting international students at the local university. But the specter of anti-semitism has been used by both sides of the conflict for months.

Now, it appears the claims of anti-Semitism are being directed back towards Moscow.

7003111,Riot Gear: How Protesters Around the World Suit Up,"Many of the photos coming out of Venezuela, Ukraine, Thailand and Turkey over the past 10 months are images of violent disarray. Pictures of fire, blood and tear gas have woven a theme of chaos into the minds of those who have seen them. Yet, while each of those nations has gone or is going through a period of violent unrest that has pitted citizens against government, a closer look at the riots shows they're not as disorganized as they seem.

No matter the country, protesters show up to clashes outfitted with gear designed to protect them from deterrents used by the state's military and/or police. They use shields to block batons, masks of all kind to make sure they don't inhale tear gas, molotov cocktails to launch attacks of their own, and more.

â€œPeople learn from each other,"" said James Lewis, director of the strategic technologies program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a bipartisan think tank. ""Thatâ€™s a global occurrence now because of the Internet, but they adjust those learnings to their own environments.â€

Below, we've broken down those adjustments country by country.

Venezuela

The first public signs of unrest in Venezuela began in early February with student protests against the government of President NicolÃ¡s Maduro. The nation's economy has taken a beating under Maduro's watch, which began in 2013. Inflation is up to nearly 60% and the value of Venezuela's currency, as compared with the U.S. dollar, has dropped to 87 to 1, a dramatic decline from the 8 to 1 ratio it was at the time of former President Hugo ChÃ¡vez's death last year.

Rallies exploded into violence on Feb. 12 when three people were killed at a gathering in the country's capital, Caracas, and the death toll has since shot up to 41(Opens in a new window). Battles between anti-government protesters and pro-government citizens backed by government security forces have sprung up along street barriers, though police recently cleared the protest city of San Cristobal of these elements of the conflict.

When and where clashes do arise, however, protesters are prepared. They've lined up riot shields of their own in the middle of the street to form walls of protection from rubber bullets and water cannons(Opens in a new window). Like protesters in Kiev, Ukraine, Venezuelans have occasionally gone on the offensive by tossing molotov cocktails at police officers. They've also employed mortars and do-it-yourself weapons such as Miguelitos(Opens in a new window), which are hoses covered in nails.

Headgear, though, is the most noticeable part of protester ""uniforms"" in Venezuela.

Some sport helmets, but masks dominate the scenes of unrest. They come in silver, blue, red and other colors, some adorned with a white star in the middle, according to images captured by the Associated Press. Other protesters are more practical, sporting gas masks to protect from tear gas.

Venezuelans have also put their own touch on the Guy Fawkes mask by painting the typically white face with the yellow, blue and red of the nation's flag. (The mask, made famous in the movie V For Vendetta, depicts the Englishman who unsuccessfully plotted to blow up the House of Lords in 1605. It's now a fixture at protests worldwide.)

Maduro sat down with leaders of the opposition on Thursday, including Henrique Capriles(Opens in a new window), who Maduro barely defeated in his run for the presidency. Reuters reports that Maduro said the meeting was ""worth it,"" but warned against expecting rapid change.

The protests have resulted in 650 injuries(Opens in a new window), and around 2,000 people have been imprisoned for some duration due to their involvement in the unrest.

Ukraine

The man in the above photo displays plenty of the gear associated with Ukrainian protesters -- molotov cocktails, gas masks and rectangular shields. But some of the fighting that happened on the streets of Kiev, Ukraine, in January and February looked like something out of a war zone in the middle ages. Many protesters strapped on metal armor and dawned helmets that look designed to deflect blows from a sword.

Riots in Kiev started after hundreds of thousands of citizens gathered in the center of the capital last November to protest former President Viktor Yanukovych's decision to reject an economic integration pact with the European Union(Opens in a new window) in favor of a Russian bailout package of around $15 billion.

Riots reached a new level of violence on Feb. 20 when clashes between police and protesters led to the deaths of at least 75, including several police officers. Soon after, Yanukovych fled the country, and Ukraine's new government is was recently embroiled in a conflict with Russia over control of the autonomous region of Crimea in the south of the country, which Russia recently annexed(Opens in a new window) after a contested referendum in which a vast majority of Crimeans voted to join Russia. Now, some of that unrest has shifted to Eastern Ukraine, where pro-Russian militias have clashed with Ukrainian armed forces.

But the people of Eastern Ukraine have yet to employ the hand-crafted weapons(Opens in a new window) carried by protesters in Kiev. In Ukraine's capital, protesters wielded everything from hammers to wooden clubs full of nails to baseball bats. Nothing they used was a match for the real bullets fired by the government -- then controlled by Russian ally Yanukovych -- but they gave rioters a means to fight back, which may have cost the protesters some support from abroad.

""I also think that there is a perception that wearing armor or carrying light weapons makes the protestors look more credible and forceful,"" Erica Chenoweth, Ph.D., an associate professor at the Josef Korbel School of International Studies at the University of Denver, told Mashable via email. ""Interestingly, though, the evidence suggests the exact inverse. In many places, the use of armor or weapons may repel sympathizers who see participation as more risky when protests take on this character, thereby undermining the power of the movement.""

Images pitting shield-carrying protesters against shield-wielding riot police flooded out of Kiev for weeks, adding to the perception that sides of equal power were clashing in the street.

That image is not reflected in the numbers, though. Reports from various days of the unrest indicate that around 10 police officers died throughout the conflict. The death toll for protesters was about 10 times that number.

Turkey

In June, 2013, Turkish citizens protested the government's plan(Opens in a new window) to pave over Gezi Park in Istanbul, the nation's largest city. Initially peaceful, the scene turned violent as government forces tear-gassed protesters and beat them with batons in an attempt to clear the park.

The total number of protesters swelled to around 3.5 million in cities across the nation before quieting down after the summer months. Still, what was initially a protest against the end of Gezi Park morphed into something of a public indictment by many Turkish citizens of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip ErdoÄŸan's government, which many consider repressive.

After months of quiet, the movement swelled again on March 11, following the death of a 15-year-old boy who had been in a coma since last July. While he was reportedly on his way to buy bread from a local store, a tear gas canister smashed into his skull. Two more deaths(Opens in a new window) in the immediate aftermath of the new wave of protests have increased tensions between citizens and government.

The death toll for protests in Turkey over the last year is now at least 10. Around 8,000 have been injured(Opens in a new window).

Despite the danger, Turkish protesters have rarely shown up to riots carrying shields or serious weaponry, James Jeffrey, former U.S. ambassador to Turkey and current visiting fellow at The Washington Institute, told Mashable. Most are outfitted in either gas masks, Guy Fawkes masks, or simple handkerchiefs tied around their mouths, according to photos taken by members of the Associated Press.

""In Turkey, there are very high penalties for assaulting a police officer,"" Jeffrey said. He says that's a serious deterrent to a lot of citizens, and a big reason why riots there have never escalated to the level of violence seen in Kiev not so long ago.

Chenoweth is not so sure. ""I think that the laws of the country matter less in matters of civil disobedience than we think,"" she said. ""In many cases, protesting is already illegal, so these people are already engaged in high-risk collective action.""

Jeffrey believes Turkey's recent past weighs heavily on the current level of violence and the weapons Turkish rioters are willing to use. In the 1970s, clashes between left- and right-wing groups left hundreds dead and he says there has since been a resulting aversion to that level of brutality.

""I think there is a real reluctance to return to the era of street battles,"" Jeffrey said.

Protesters in Istanbul and Ankara, Turkey's capital, were met with tear gas and water cannons during the most recent bouts of unrest in March, but rioters have not responded with levels of violence seen in other countries.

Thailand

Thai protesters have been clad in all types of gas masks, relied on slingshots and hand-thrown projectiles, and have rarely been pictured using any kind of riot shield. Recently, though, riots escalated to the worst political violence the nation has seen in years.

Citizen unrest in Bangkok, the nation's capital, has centered around support for or opposition to Thaksin Shinawatra, who was ousted as premier in a 2006 military coup and has been in self-imposed exile in the United Kingdom since 2008. Though he faces corruption charges, he is said to still have great influence in Thailand. His sister is current Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra, and many were angered after a bill that was introduced last August and amended in November would have allowed her brother to re-enter the country without going to jail.

Last December, the prime minister called for elections that were scheduled for February, but citizens in opposition to the current government boycotted the vote(Opens in a new window). Rioters have called for an unelected council to reform what they believe to be a corrupt political process.

But there are also rioters of a different kind. Known as the ""red shirts,"" they are supporters of deposed former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, and a clash between them and police on April 10 resulted in the worst political violence Thailand has seen in 18 years, according to The Guardian(Opens in a new window). They gathered in Bangkok to support the current government, but when police and soldiers fired rubber bullets and tear gas at them to try to disperse the crowd, rioters responded with live ammunition, petrol bombs and grenades. At least 15 people died and 521 were injured, including 64 police and soldiers.

The scene on April 10 was perhaps foreshadowed on Feb. 20 when five people died(Opens in a new window) -- including one police officer -- after both sides took to firing bullets at each other. This skirmish was between anti-government protesters and police.

The use of deadly weapons in recent months marks a distinct escalation from the slingshots and simple gas masks seen in the above photos, though a definitive reason for the escalation remains unclear.

But something else, Lewis said, is quite clear. Demonstrations in Thailand 20 years ago might have resulted in a few paragraphs in the New York Times. Now, protest videos on YouTube spread across the web on a semi-regular basis, resulting in more media coverage, a better understanding of how protesters in different nations respond to government forces, and greater tendency for rioters across the globe to learn, and evolve, from each other.",4/17/2014 0:00,0.510638,5,4,0,4.53092,10,Lifestyle,1199.8,4623.446,3367.064,1300,0.51684,-0.02312,0.048265,0.045249,0.7,-0.4,1500

7003199,Rolex: How a 109-Year-Old Brand Thrives in the Digital Age,"Last year, the decision makers at Rolex(Opens in a new window) decided the time was right for a shakeup.

Unlike with most ""shakeups,"" however, there wouldn't be widespread corporate reorganization, and scores of merchandise wouldnâ€™t be cut.

Instead, Rolex executives decided that it was time for the company to launch its first branded Facebook page(Opens in a new window), a herculean leap for a brand that has, for decades, closely monitored its reputation and only made tweaks -- in both its watches and marketing strategies -- after subjecting them to significant scrutiny.

""Creating buzz is not the intent,"" the brand told Mashable. ""We craft our content thoughtfully, privilege quality over quantity, talk only when we have something to say and when we feel it's right.""

Agency partners whoâ€™ve worked with Rolex tell a similar story. The heritage lifestyle label doesn't do random, they say, and its late arrival to the social media party was no mistake or oversight. Rather, they believe, Rolex's reticence was a calculated play. The brand knew it would not diminish its legacy or lose its loyal support base by staying away from social media at first. It wanted to know everything it could about social marketing and engagement data before it took the plunge.

Over the past century, precision has become Rolexâ€™s guiding principle, encompassing everything from its watches to its product marketing. Hereâ€™s how the brand monopolized a message and withstood the temptations to cheapen it in the social media age.

Print Ads: Rolexes and Achievement

A 1927 print ad depicting Mercedes Gleitze's momentous swim Credit: Rolex

Since 1905, the hallmark of Rolexâ€™s messaging has been the supreme craftsmanship and innovativeness of its watches, as well as the milestones theyâ€™ve witnessed.

In 1927, for example, Mercedes Gleitze became the first British woman to cross the English Channel. She did so wearing a state-of-the-art Rolex Oyster(Opens in a new window), the first waterproof watch ever invented.

After Gleitzeâ€™s historic swim, Rolex took out a front page ad in Englandâ€™s Daily Mail to trumpet the feat and showcase its new watch. In doing so, Rolex introduced what would become known as the â€œtestimony concept.â€ In the 1927 placement, the copy describes the qualities of the watch (waterproof), while the witness (Gleitze) provides testimony that Rolexâ€™s claims of a waterproof watch are true.

â€œMore than ten hours of submersion under the most trying to conditions failed to harm its perfect timekeeping,â€ the ad proclaims. â€œ...Perfect timekeeping under all conditions is at last a possibility.â€

The next decade, a Rolex would again be worn during a historic feat. In 1935, British racecar driver Malcolm Campbell broke the worldâ€™s speed record at the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah. Campbell, an avid Rolex fan, wore an Oyster during the record-breaking race and timed his laps with the accessory.

In a subsequent Rolex ad celebrating Campbellâ€™s achievement, the driver is shown in his famous Bluebird car. Below him is a re-printed letter that Campbell sent to Rolex lauding the companyâ€™s watch.

â€œI have now been using my Rolex Watch for a while,â€ he says, â€œand it is keeping perfect time under somewhat strenuous conditions.â€

In the following decades, Rolexes would be worn during epochal climbs, deep-sea dives and intercontinental flights.

In the 1950s, Rolex began capitalizing commercially on the history its watches had been apart of.

Members of John Hunt's expedition wore Oysters as they ascended Mount Everest Credit: Rolex

In 1953, for example, when Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay became the first climbers to reach the summit of Mount Everest, Rolex honored the men by modeling a watch, the Oyster Perpetual Explorer(Opens in a new window), after them (the menâ€™s expedition was equipped with Oysters).

Then, after oceanographers Jacques Piccard and Don Walsh, wearing Oysters, reached Marianas Trench, Rolex modeled three subsequent watch lines after them: the Submariner, the Deep Sea Special and the Sea-Dweller.

Rolex on Film: A Witness to History

In recent TV ads, Rolex has reinforced the notion that its watches are iconic and witnesses to history, a tenet that has become central to its brand storytelling. Though the past often seeps into Rolexâ€™s present-day marketing, the company says it isnâ€™t trying to sell empty nostalgia.

â€œBrands with rich histories always walk a tightrope between the future and the past,â€ it tells Mashable. â€œAnd true history is not about nostalgia.â€

Instead, Rolex positions its watches as accessories to history, not motionless spectators.

One of the companyâ€™s best-received campaigns is a series of commercials with the tagline, ""It doesn't just tell time; it tells history.""

The watchmaker produced a few different variations on the theme, including individual videos that highlight the achievements of professional athletes like tennis player Roger Federer(Opens in a new window), who has been the omnipresent face of Rolex since 2006, and golf legends Tiger Woods(Opens in a new window) and Jack Nicklaus(Opens in a new window).

In the Woods commercial, the narration cleverly describes the common ground between the watches and Woods.

â€œThis watch has seen ... uncanny precision and impossible physics, on golfâ€™s most hallowed grounds,â€ the narrator says, reminding the audience of the traits shared by Woods and a Rolex.

Though Rolex has become an indelible presence at sports events like tennisâ€™ Australian Open and golfâ€™s Open Championship, the brand has channeled other icons as well, drawing them in from political, artistic and cinematic spheres.

In another commercial that highlights luminaries throughout history, Rolex again plants its product as a witness to history, much like it did with its print ads in the 20th century.

â€œThis watch is a witness to words that have moved nations,â€ the narrator states as snapshots of Winston Churchill and Martin Luther king are flashed.

â€œItâ€™s dared men faster ... further,â€ he adds as portraits of James Cameron, Jackie Stewart and Paul Newman play over the words.

Rolex on Social Media: No Random Acts of Content

When Rolex made its long-awaited jump into social media, it didnâ€™t roll out all of its assets at once. Instead, it segmented its approach, starting with a YouTube launch(Opens in a new window) in 2012.

When it introduced its branded YouTube channel(Opens in a new window), Rolex was wise not to bloat the page with product ads, which consumers generally shy away from. Instead, Rolex used the platform to launch in-house documentaries about topics that matter to the brand and its devotees, like Himalayan expeditions and deep-sea missions to investigate the polar ice caps.

""Our communication on social media enables a better understanding of the brand, its universe, and its values,"" Rolex tells Mashable.

Agency sources say Rolex, on YouTube and its new Facebook hub(Opens in a new window), practices extreme caution and strategy calculation. Rather than publishing content for content's sake, the brand meticulously selects what media tells the brand's story best.

Post(Opens in a new window) by ROLEX(Opens in a new window).

Rolex also prides itself on social listening, i.e., scraping brand mentions from its own and other social networks and using that data -- what people are saying and how they're saying it -- to identify what consumers want to see from the brand on social media.

Last July, after mining Facebook comments, Rolex observed that users wanted to learn more about the distinctive features of its watches. One in particular, the quirky roman numerals on Rolexes, piqued commentersâ€™ curiosity. In response, Rolex launched a â€œDid You Knowâ€ series to explain why Rolex uses IIII, the â€œClockmakerâ€™s Four,â€(Opens in a new window) instead of IV.

The post was a hit. Out of all the content on Rolexâ€™s Facebook page, the Clockmakerâ€™s Four explainer garnered the most likes -- nearly 119,000. For Rolex, the success was a sign that its careful social listening paid off and created brand advocates.

Though Rolex has only been on Facebook for a year, itâ€™s already made a splash. In the social network's â€œprestige category,â€ Rolex has the highest engagement rate.

Agency sources say the brand believes its starting to listen to the right conversations on its social channels, which also include a Pinterest page(Opens in a new window).

But unlike its flagship app that tracks activity during exercise, the company's latest app will track all your daily activity, not just during workouts.

Breeze functions much like a Fitbit, Nike+ Fuelband and other fitness trackers. It keeps tabs on your movements throughout the day, sets activity goals and provides detailed data on your progress.

[seealso slug=""best-iphone-armbands/""]

But what sets it apart from other trackers is how it collects data. The app relies on motion data automatically collected by the iPhone 5S' M7 coprocessor, enabling the app to constantly monitor users' activity without putting extra strain on the device's battery.

""Smartphones are what took active fitness tracking to the masses,"" RunKeeper CEO Jason Jacobs told Mashable. ""Now it's starting to be possible to have a phone that tracks you invisibly without you having to do anything. It takes all the friction out of tracking your movement throughout the day.""

RunKeeper's new activity-tracking app Breeze calculates a step goals based on a user's previous patterns Credit: RunKeeper

After you launch the app and sign in, it automatically calculates a step goal based on your activity from the previous seven days, assuming the record exists on the chip. The app extends beyond just tracking a user's progress toward a step goal; the longer the app is installed, the smarter it gets. It learns your daily patterns -- the times of day you're most active, for example -- and will surface contextual notifications at different times based on your patterns.

Breeze is the first time RunKeeper has released an app not targeted at athletes or other fitness buffs.

""There's a whole bunch of other people who want to lead an active life but aren't ready to put on their gym clothes and sweat and they might be intimidated by an app like RunKeeper,"" Jacobs said. ""We should have a framework to serve them in whatever mode they're in and help them lead a more active life.""

Jacobs added that the company has many more features planned for Breeze, including more personalization options, integration between Breeze and RunKeeper and compatibility with more devices, including Android handsets with similar sensors and motion-tracking technology.

My new acquaintance, whom we'll call Steve, has just organized one of the first Secret IRL meetups, which began with this simple Secret: ""Starting yet another expensive, consumption habit: artisanal whiskey. San Francisco, you can keep your $4 toast.""

Credit:

The Secret appeared in my feed because Steve is a ""friend of friend,"" meaning a contact saved in my phone book is also saved in his. It could easily be someone we exchanged numbers with for an OKCupid date or to purchase furniture via Craigslist. The social filtering is what makes Secret unique from other anonymous apps Yik Yak and Whisper -- there's no guarantee you'll see all posts from friends, because each user only sees a few new posts each day.

[seealso slug=""after-work-apps""]

The kicker that separates Secret from pseudonymous sites such as Reddit is that identity doesn't follow you -- you cannot build a reputation. On each Secret thread, you're a new ""you."" Thus, if you reveal yourself on Secret by sharing too much identifying information, it won't out your other Secrets.

The more I've used Secret, the more often I've seen invitations to extend the conversation outside the app. That is not surprising, as many users share personal, intimate information (fears, medical difficulties, early pregnancies) that could benefit from real-life support.

Perhaps that's why four Secret users, upon finding they, first, share an affinity for whiskey and, second, live in New York, decided to meet. Steve dropped a shortened Bitly link into the thread that led to a calendar tool, and four users added the days they were available. Then Steve updated the thread with our date and venue: Friday, 8 p.m. at Maysville, a whiskey bar in Manhattan.

Secret reveals location of popular posts, but only friends can comment on the thread. Credit:

On my way to the blind whiskey date, I wondered what the interaction would be like -- might the conversation skew personal and authentic, since the introduction had been made in that context?

Although four Secret users confirmed in the thread that they would join, one cancelled, citing illness. Steve arrived with a friend, also a Secret user (we'll call him Ben), whom he had coincidentally run into on his way to the bar, but who did not post on the thread. All of us work in tech-related fields, which seems to be the case for the majority of Secret users.

In addition to talking about Secret itself, we also talked about failed relationships and work frustrations, which, once I mentioned I worked at Mashable, Steve said were ""off the record."" This confirmed my suspicion that meeting on Secret might lead to us dropping, well, secrets -- in real life, too.

7022961,Snowden Asks Putin on Live TV If He Spies on Russians,"In what could be best described as a bizarre PR stunt, Edward Snowden made a surprise appearance on live TV to ask Russian President Vladimir Putin whether he spies on his citizens.

Snowden, who has received asylum in Russia, appeared during Putin's annual call-in show on Russian TV on Thursday, during which Putin answered questions from the public. It's unclear whether Snowden's appearance was staged, but his question gave Putin a chance to poke at his favorite target: the United States.

SEE ALSO: The World According to Vladimir Putin

""Does Russia store, intercept, or analyze, in any way, the communications of millions of individuals, and do you believe that simply increasing the effectiveness of intelligence or law enforcement investigations can justify a place in societies rather than subjects under surveillance?"" Snowden asked Putin (see the full exchange in the video embedded below).

""Mr. Snowden, you are a former agent, a spy. I used to work for the intelligence service, we are going to talk one professional language,"" Putin said, according to a translation by state-run TV channel Russia Today. ""We don't have as much money as they have in the States and we don't have these technical devices that they have in the States. Our special services, thank God, are strictly controlled by society and the law and regulated by the law.""

Russia clearly has means to ""respond"" to terrorists and criminals who use technology, Putin added, but doesn't have ""uncontrollable efforts like [in America].""

What Putin didn't say, however, is that Russia actually boasts one of the most sophisticated surveillance systems in the world, described by some as ""PRISM on steroids."" This system, known as SORM, practically gives the Federal Security Service (FSB) direct access to Internet servers and telecommunications providers, allowing the government to eavesdrop on all online and phone communications that go through their networks.

Even though the FSB must get warrants before accessing any data or communications, they don't have to show them to anyone, as Andrei Soldatov, an independent journalist who has written extensively about Russia's surveillance powers, told Mashable in January.

""From the beginning, [SORM] was more totalitarian, more invasive, more flexible, and in some ways even more effective than the Western approach,"" Soldatov said previously.",4/17/2014 0:00,0.685841,4,0,2,4.391304,7,Entertainment,0,4123.765,2033.248,14750,0.335245,0.000216,0.021739,0.013043,0,0,851
7022974,You Can Now Invest in Your Neighbors' Solar Energy Projects,"Here's another reason to be nice to the neighbors: They might just give you a no-money-down, low-cost loan to put solar panels on your roof, and once you pay off that debt you'll get essentially free electricity as long as you own your home.

Welcome to the latest innovation in renewable energy: The crowdsourced solar loan.

The loans are administered by Mosaic(Opens in a new window), an Oakland, Calif., startup that made its name by letting ordinary investors - that's you and me - put money into commercial and non-profit solar projects(Opens in a new window) that were once the exclusive domain of big banks and corporations like Google.

In the coming months, the environmentally minded can go to Mosaic's site and invest in portfolios of 20-year loans made to homeowners. (Each individual loan will be scrubbed of identifying information.) Mosaic is offering the loans through a partnership with solar installer RGS Energy(Opens in a new window).

The interest rate is 4.99% as long as homeowners pay down the loan with a 30% federal tax credit they'll receive for installing a solar system. If they keep the tax credit, the rate jumps to 10% after 18 months.

""We think a solar loan if structured right can open up the market and make solar more affordable and accessible for more homeowners,"" Mosaic co-founder Billy Parish told The Atlantic.

That goes against the grain of solar financing. In recent years, leases have driven the explosion in residential solar installations(Opens in a new window) as they let homeowners avoid the typical five-figure cost of buying a solar array. Instead, homeowners would pay a monthly fee to a solar installer like SolarCity or Sungevity that in most cases is less than what they'd fork over to their local utility for electricity. In California, for instance, leases account for two-thirds of residential solar installations.

But leases also are a product of the peculiar way the federal government subsidizes solar energy in the United States.

Individuals and businesses that install solar panels qualify for a 30% tax credit - known as the investment tax credit, or ITC. Since young solar companies like SolarCity have few taxes to offset, they instead transfer the credits to banks and corporations that put up funds to finance the installation of solar systems for homeowners. These so-called tax equity funds have financed billions of dollars in residential leases in recent years.

But with the ITC set to decline to 10% at the end of 2016, tax equity investors are expected to look for other places to put their money. In the meantime, rooftop solar has gone from being one of those nutty-crunchy California affectations to a mainstream phenomenon and a hedge against rising electricity prices.

That mean homeowners more comfortable taking out loans to pay for a solar system.

""Solar is no longer an emerging technology,"" says Jon Doochin, chief executive of Soligent(Opens in a new window), a California solar distributor that provides financing and other services to independent solar installers. ""People say, 'Solar I get it.' ""

More important, banks get it. So these days companies like Soligent can offer loan financing at competitive rates - around 6% to 14% - to homeowners who previously would have had to tap their home equity lines or credit cards to pay for a solar system.

""The rates are dropping significantly because people have more confidence in the technology,"" says Doochin.

And there's another reason homeowners may increasingly opt to own rather than rent: A study by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory found that a solar system boosted a home's resale price(Opens in a new window) by $17,000.

According to CNN affiliate YTN, only one out of 46 lifeboats was deployed after the accident on board the ferry, which carried more than 470 people, many of them high school students on a trip to a local island. Of that total, 287 passengers are still missing at sea, and 179 have been rescued. Nine people are confirmed dead, and the death toll is expected to rise.

The reason behind the accident is still a mystery, as no one knows exactly why the ferry sank. ""There was no huge difference between their plan and the actual track chart,"" South Korean Oceans and Fisheries Ministry spokesman Nam Jae Heon said of reports that the ferry went off-route.

As rescue efforts continue on Thursday, families of the missing must tragically wait for answers as to the fate of their loved ones.

Students Told To Stay In Place

Students aboard the stricken ferry were told to stay in place with their life jackets on, even as the ferry tilted so far that they stood awkwardly on benches to keep from falling over. Videos alleged to be from within the ferry show students calmly awaiting further instructions, some of them barefoot and huddled in place, as the ferry listed.

The South Korean coast guard has released raw video that shows the dramatic search and rescue efforts at the scene as they ferry slowly disappeared underwater.

â€œThere was an announcement telling us to sit still, but the ferry was already sinking. Some of the students were not able to escape,"" one witness told the BBC. Another survivor told local television that students had jumped into the freezing ocean wearing life jackets before swimming to a nearby rescue boat. ""As the ferry was shaking and tilting, we all tripped and bumped into each another,"" he said. The ocean ""was so cold ... I was hurrying, thinking that I wanted to live.""

A third said(Opens in a new window), ""We must have waited 30 to 40 minutes after the crew told us to stay put. Then everything tilted over and everyone started screaming and scrambling to get out.""

""If people had jumped into the water... they could have been rescued. But we were told not to go out,"" said another, according to the Associated Press.

According to The New York Times(Opens in a new window), the shipâ€™s communications officer, Kang Hae-seong, 32, said that he thought matters would have been made worse if passengers had fled in a panic. â€œI repeatedly told people to calm themselves and stay where they were for an hour,â€ he said. â€œI didnâ€™t have time to look at the manual for evacuation.â€

Claim: Heartbreaking Texts From Students to Parents: ""I Love You""

A South Korean media outlet, The Kyunghyang Shinmun(Opens in a new window), says it obtained a screenshot of an emotional text message exchange between a student aboard the ferry and his mother.

South Korea's National Police Agency, however, says it believes the text message exchange is a hoax(Opens in a new window) -- and has a suspect under investigation.

Mashable translated the rumored text message, which reads:

9:34 a.m. - Why..? I was wondering why you werenâ€™t checking your KakaoTalk (a Korean messaging app similar to WhatsApp).

9:36 a.m. - Me too, son.. I love you..

The student has since been rescued, according to a report from the CBC(Opens in a new window), although South Korea's National Police Agency says(Opens in a new window) names of those on the message (and others) do not match a list of students on board the ship.

Bad Weather Hampers Search for Survivors

An enormous rescue operation that involves more than 500 divers, 169 vessels and 29 aircraft is underway. However, bad weather and strong currents are hampering the search for survivors, the BBC reports(Opens in a new window).

""We found ourselves in challenging weather conditions today - very low cloud ceilings and reduced visibility and rain, and we're working a search area around the site in close co-ordination with the South Korean on-scene commander,"" Captain Joey Tynch of the USS Bonhomme Richard said. The US Navy had sent his ship to assist in the search for survivors.

While families remain hopeful, some rescuers are beginning to doubt that their search efforts will find anyone alive in the wrecked ship.

""Honestly, I think the chances of finding anyone alive are close to zero,"" one coast guard official said to a journalist(Opens in a new window) on a rescue boat.

Surprisingly, though, the singer had never attended a bridal shower until this past weekend, when she surprised a longtime fan.

Swift recorded the entire experience and shared it on her YouTube page on Wednesday. In the video, she explains finding a wedding invitation for a woman named Gena Gabrielle in her fan mail. Swift decided since she couldn't make the wedding, she'd pop by the bridal shower in Ohio instead.

She didn't show up empty-handed, of course. Swift brought Gena an armful of gifts -- including homemade chocolate chip cookies and a KitchenAid mixer.

7002995,How 2 Animators Independently Recreated Pixar Magic,"Pixar art directors Robert Kondo and Dice Tsutsumi know a thing or two about how to tell stories with animation. The duo worked together to create characters in Monsters University and Toy Story 3 and are familiar with some of the most sophisticated animation tools on the planet.

When Kondo and Tsutsumi took a three-month leave to work on a short film called The Dam Keeper(Opens in a new window), they had to leave all that behind. The film falls under Pixar's Co-op Program, which exists so employees can challenge themselves with hands-on learning of production techniques -- but without the help of studio dollars, guidance or even office space.

To make it happen, they looked to low-cost digital and social technologies to create a virtual â€œcentral officeâ€ for production.

""Pixar has robust and complex pipeline for making great films, but on The Dam Keeper we had to find a way to use elements of that pipeline that we know,"" director Kondo told Mashable. ""We needed to engineer new solutions because of the 2D and painterly look of the film. It required a lot of engineering to go from storyboards, the edit suite and traditional animation to painted frames in Photoshop, then back to edit suite.""

The Dam Keeper is an 18-minute short film with an anti-bullying message that follows a young pig with an important job and a new classmate who changes everything. The film, which blends traditional hand-drawn animation with digital painting techniques, debuted earlier this year at the 2014 Berlin International Film Festival. It's currently making the rounds at other festivals worldwide, with its next stop at the San Francisco International Film Festival on April 26th.

""Processes in animation are changing all the time and it's great that technology is helping to make communication, information organization and collaboration easier,"" he said. ""It allows filmmakers like us who want to gain experience with things they have never done before and jump right in. A decade ago, our film would have had to have changed in scope, complexity and quality to be able to be done in the time we wanted to complete it.""

The duo spent the first year of production writing together and finding the story.

""We used Google docs to pass treatments back and forth and the first pitch was created with that platform, too,"" Kondo said. ""Communication was instantaneous and remote. Our first treatments were written from the comfort of our home studios, cafes, and spaces that encouraged our creativity -- so long as they had Internet.""

The team later grew to about 70 volunteers -- some with Pixar working experience and others without. To eventually replicate a traditional studio environment, the team rented a space in Emeryville, Calif. that served to hang inspiration boards, concept art and gather in person. They started using Box to share files, since the service allowed them to preserve different versions of a file and collaborate through comments, which made it easy to give and receive feedback to its team of animators.

They were also able to monitor the project's health and pace by watching uploads and conversations on Box.

""When an artist painted the scene, they would tag the two of us and let us know they were ready for review,"" Kondo said. ""We'd be able to save over the file with a paint-over along with notes and not have to worry about losing anything and worked back and forth like this until the painting was complete.""

""It was great to have such transparency between artists and production staff,"" he added.

The team also used a French animation program called TVPaint and all frames were painted in Adobe Photoshop, using adjustment layers to paint lighting on characters.

""This allowed for consistency when working with different painters,"" Kondo said. ""We used maya to pre-visualize the film, as well as 3D software because we had access to great resources because of our previous experiences. It allowed us the greatest exploration of scene layout in the shortest amount of time.""

Meanwhile, composers Zach Johnston and Matteo Roberts both used Apple GarageBand to record and build the demo score.

""Because the team was a small size, people on our crew were able to step up into leadership roles and work in areas different from their normal roles at Pixar,"" Kondo said.

The finished film, whose trailer is available on YouTube, shows how well Kondo and Tsutsumi's techniques worked. You'd never know the tools they used weren't a part of a large studio budget.

""It's rare for a company that makes film to allow their employees to do personal film projects on the side, but we're grateful for it,"" Kondo said.",4/17/2014 0:00,0.447368,7,1,0,4.667961,8,Business,0,4763.083,2709.129,0,0.494445,0.144969,0.069903,0.020388,0.833333,0.433333,1900

The dramatic trailer for The Rover, which is set in a dangerous future where civilization and its laws have disintegrated into anarchy, came out Thursday -- the same day the film was chosen as a Cannes Film Festival selection(Opens in a new window). It will now debut at the festival in May.
